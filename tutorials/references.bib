 abstract = {Experience in the physical sciences suggests that the only realistic means of understanding complex systems is through the use of mathematical models. Typically, this has come to mean the identification of quantitative models expressed as differential equations. Quantitative modelling works best when the structure of the model (i.e., the form of the equations) is known; and the primary concern is one of estimating the values of the parameters in the model. For complex biological systems, the model-structure is rarely known and the modeler has to deal with both model-identification and parameter-estimation. In this paper we are concerned with providing automated assistance to the first of these problems. Specifically, we examine the identification by machine of the structural relationships between experimentally observed variables. These relationship will be expressed in the form of qualitative abstractions of a quantitative model. Such qualitative models may not only provide clues to the precise quantitative model, but also assist in understanding the essence of that model. Our position in this paper is that background knowledge incorporating system modelling principles can be used to constrain effectively the set of good qualitative models. Utilising the model-identification framework provided by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) we present empirical support for this position using a series of increasingly complex artificial datasets. The results are obtained with qualitative and quantitative data subject to varying amounts of noise and different degrees of sparsity. The results also point to the presence of a set of qualitative states, which we term kernel subsets, that may be necessary for a qualitative model-learner to learn correct models. We demonstrate scalability of the method to biological system modelling by identification of the glycolysis metabolic pathway from data.},

@article{Aberra.2018,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

We implemented computational models of human and rat cortical neurons for simulating the neural response to cortical stimulation with electromagnetic fields.

APPROACH

We adapted model neurons from the library of Blue Brain models to reflect biophysical and geometric properties of both adult rat and human cortical neurons and coupled the model neurons to exogenous electric fields (E-fields). The models included 3D reconstructed axonal and dendritic arbors, experimentally-validated electrophysiological behaviors, and multiple, morphological variants within cell types. Using these models, we characterized the single-cell responses to intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) and uniform E-field with dc as well as pulsed currents.

MAIN RESULTS

The strength-duration and current-distance characteristics of the model neurons to ICMS agreed with published experimental results, as did the subthreshold polarization of cell bodies and axon terminals by uniform dc E-fields. For all forms of stimulation, the lowest threshold elements were terminals of the axon collaterals, and the dependence of threshold and polarization on spatial and temporal stimulation parameters was strongly affected by morphological features of the axonal arbor, including myelination, diameter, and branching.

SIGNIFICANCE

These results provide key insights into the mechanisms of cortical stimulation. The presented models can be used to study various cortical stimulation modalities while incorporating detailed spatial and temporal features of the applied E-field.},

@article{Adibzadeh.2015,
 abstract = {Among various possible health effects of mobile phone radiation, the risk of inducing cancer has the strongest interest of laymen and health organizations. Recently, the Interphone epidemiological study investigated the association between the estimated Radio Frequency (RF) dose from mobile phones and the risk of developing a brain tumor. Their dosimetric analysis included over 100 phone models but only two homogeneous head phantoms. So, the potential impact of individual morphological features on global and local RF absorption in the brain was not investigated. In this study, we performed detailed dosimetric simulations for 20 head models and quantified the variation of RF dose in different brain regions as a function of head morphology. Head models were exposed to RF fields from generic mobile phones at 835 and 1900 MHz in the {\dq}tilted{\dq} and {\dq}cheek{\dq} positions. To evaluate the local RF dose variation, we used and compared two different post-processing methods, that is, averaging specific absorption rate (SAR) over Talairach regions and over sixteen predefined 1 cm(3) cube-shaped field-sensors. The results show that the variation in the averaged SAR among the heads can reach up to 16.4 dB at a 1 cm(3) cube inside the brain (field-sensor method) and alternatively up to 15.8 dB in the medulla region (Talairach method). In conclusion, we show head morphology as an important uncertainty source for dosimetric studies of mobile phones. Therefore, any dosimetric analysis dealing with RF dose at a specific region in the brain (e.g., tumor risk analysis) should be based upon real morphology.},

@article{Ahdab.2010,
 abstract = {Since about 15 years, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used as a technique to investigate the function of specific cortical regions. Single pulse TMS studies have targeted the dorsolateral premotor cortex (dlPMC) to characterize premotor-motor interactions in movement disorders. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) trials have targeted the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to treat depression. In almost all previous studies, these targets have been defined according to a {\dq}standard{\dq} scalp distance to the site of stimulation evoking motor responses of maximal amplitude in the contralateral hand ({\dq}hand motor hotspot{\dq} corresponding to the primary motor cortex, M1). The {\dq}standard{\dq} procedure of coil positioning locates the dlPMC and dlPFC as 2-3 and 5cm, respectively, anterior to the {\dq}hand motor hotspot{\dq}. The aim of our study was to compare the locations of M1, dlPMC and dlPFC targets provided by the {\dq}standard{\dq} procedure of coil positioning and those provided by using a neuronavigation system integrating individual brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-two patients were enrolled, all being treated for depressive symptoms in the context of chronic pain syndrome. The centers of the dlPMC and dlPFC regions were accurately targeted by the {\dq}standard{\dq} procedure in 14 and eight patients (64 and 36{\%} of the series), respectively. In the other patients, the {\dq}standard{\dq} procedure located the dlPMC target on the M1/dlPMC border and the dlPFC target on the dlPMC/dlPFC border. On average, the MRI-guided location of M1, dlPMC, and dlPFC was, respectively, 6.1mm posterior, 31.7mm anterior and 69.0mm anterior to the {\dq}hand motor hotspot{\dq}. The {\dq}standard{\dq} procedure failed to accurately locate the dlPMC and dlPFC targets by about 1 and 2cm, respectively. A statistical analysis of the MRI coordinates (x, y, z) of the targets revealed that the M1 target was more posterior, the dlPMC target more superficial and the dlPFC target more anterior, lateral, and deeper, using neuronavigation compared to the {\dq}standard{\dq} procedure. This study confirms that the {\dq}standard{\dq} procedure of coil positioning is not accurate to target a desired cortical region. Target location can be improved by the use of a navigation system taking individual brain anatomy into account. The present results incline to be cautious on the pathophysiological interpretations of previous results reported in TMS studies based on {\dq}standard{\dq} targeting, e.g. regarding premotor-motor interactions. Similarly, the inaccuracy of the {\dq}standard{\dq} procedure of coil positioning could partly explain the between-study variability of the therapeutic effects produced by rTMS in patients with depression. Our results strongly support a more anterior and lateral placement of the TMS coil for dlPFC stimulation in the treatment of depression.},

We used a model that considers variations in skull thicknesses to determine the conductivity of the tri-layer skull and its individual anatomical structures. The results indicate that the conductivities of the spongiform (16.2-41.1 milliS/m), the top compact (5.4-7.2 milliS/m) and lower compact (2.8-10.2 milliS/m) layers of the skull have significantly different and inhomogeneous conductivities.

 abstract = {The electrical conductivities (sigma) of freshly excised neocortex and subcortical white matter were studied in the frequency range of physiological relevance for EEG (5-1005 Hz) in 21 patients (ages 0.67 to 55 years) undergoing epilepsy neurosurgery. Surgical patients were classified as having cortical dysplasia (CD) or non-CD pathologies. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) was obtained in 9 patients. Results found that electrical conductivities in freshly excised neocortex vary significantly from patient to patient (sigma = 0.0660-0.156 S/m). Cerebral cortex from CD patients had increased conductivities compared with non-CD cases. In addition, longer seizure durations positively correlated with conductivities for CD tissue, while they negatively correlated for non-CD tissue. DTI ADC eigenvalues inversely correlated with electrical conductivity in CD and non-CD tissue. These results in a small initial cohort indicate that electrical conductivity of freshly excised neocortex from epilepsy surgery patients varies as a consequence of clinical variables, such as underlying pathology and seizure duration, and inversely correlates with DTI ADC values. Understanding how disease affects cortical electrical conductivity and ways to non-invasively measure it, perhaps through DTI, could enhance the ability to localize EEG dipoles and other relevant information in the treatment of epilepsy surgery patients.},

 abstract = {Source localization models assume brain electrical conductivities are isotropic at about 0.33 S/m. These assumptions have not been confirmed ex vivo in humans. This study determined bidirectional electrical conductivities from pediatric epilepsy surgery patients. Electrical conductivities perpendicular and parallel to the pial surface of neocortex and subcortical white matter (n = 15) were measured using the 4-electrode technique and compared with clinical variables. Mean (+/-SD) electrical conductivities were 0.10 +/- 0.01 S/m, and varied by 243{\%} from patient to patient. Perpendicular and parallel conductivities differed by 45{\%}, and the larger values were perpendicular to the pial surface in 47{\%} and parallel in 40{\%} of patients. A perpendicular principal axis was associated with normal, while isotropy and parallel principal axes were linked with epileptogenic lesions by MRI. Electrical conductivities were decreased in patients with cortical dysplasia compared with non-dysplasia etiologies. The electrical conductivity values of freshly excised human brain tissues were approximately 30{\%} of assumed values, varied by over 200{\%} from patient to patient, and had erratic anisotropic and isotropic shapes if the MRI showed a lesion. Understanding brain electrical conductivity and ways to non-invasively measure them are probably necessary to enhance the ability to localize EEG sources from epilepsy surgery patients.},

 abstract = {{\dq}Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian modeling by the use of computation using the R language. The early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace's method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples.{\dq}--Jacket.},

 abstract = {The use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an important treatment option for movement disorders and other medical conditions. Today, three major manufacturers provide implantable systems for DBS. Although the underlying principle is basically the same for all available systems, the differences in the technical features vary considerably. This article outlines aspects regarding the technical features of DBS systems. The differences between voltage and current sources are addressed and their effect on stimulation is shown. To maintain clinical benefit and minimize side effects the stimulation field has to be adapted to the requirements of the patient. Shaping of the stimulation field can be achieved by the electrode design and polarity configuration. Furthermore, the electric signal consisting of stimulation rate, stimulation amplitude and pulse width affect the stimulation field. Interleaving stimulation is an additional concept, which permits improved treatment outcomes. Therefore, the electrode design, the polarity, the electric signal, and the concept of interleaving stimulation are presented. The investigated systems can be also categorized as rechargeable and non-rechargeable, which is briefly discussed. Options for interconnecting different system components from various manufacturers are presented. The present paper summarizes the technical features and their combination possibilities, which can have a major impact on the therapeutic effect.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used for the mapping of brain motor functions. The complexity of the brain deters determining the exact localization of the stimulation site using simplified methods (e.g., the region below the center of the TMS coil) or conventional computational approaches.

OBJECTIVE

This study aimed to present a high-precision localization method for a specific motor area by synthesizing computed non-uniform current distributions in the brain for multiple sessions of TMS.

METHODS

Peritumoral mapping by TMS was conducted on patients who had intra-axial brain neoplasms located within or close to the motor speech area. The electric field induced by TMS was computed using realistic head models constructed from magnetic resonance images of patients. A post-processing method was implemented to determine a TMS hotspot by combining the computed electric fields for the coil orientations and positions that delivered high motor-evoked potentials during peritumoral mapping. The method was compared to the stimulation site localized via intraoperative direct brain stimulation and navigated TMS.

RESULTS

Four main results were obtained: 1) the dependence of the computed hotspot area on the number of peritumoral measurements was evaluated; 2) the estimated localization of the hand motor area in eight non-affected hemispheres was in good agreement with the position of a so-called {\dq}hand-knob{\dq}; 3) the estimated hotspot areas were not sensitive to variations in tissue conductivity; and 4) the hand motor areas estimated by this proposal and direct electric stimulation (DES) were in good agreement in the ipsilateral hemisphere of four glioma patients.

CONCLUSION(S)

The TMS localization method was validated by well-known positions of the {\dq}hand-knob{\dq} in brains for the non-affected hemisphere, and by a hotspot localized via DES during awake craniotomy for the tumor-containing hemisphere.},

 abstract = {Neuronal response properties are typically probed by intracellular measurements of current-voltage (I-V) relationships during application of current or voltage steps. Here we demonstrate the measurement of a novel I-V curve measured while the neuron exhibits a fluctuating voltage and emits spikes. This dynamic I-V curve requires only a few tens of seconds of experimental time and so lends itself readily to the rapid classification of cell type, quantification of heterogeneities in cell populations, and generation of reduced analytical models. We apply this technique to layer-5 pyramidal cells and show that their dynamic I-V curve comprises linear and exponential components, providing experimental evidence for a recently proposed theoretical model. The approach also allows us to determine the change of neuronal response properties after a spike, millisecond by millisecond, so that postspike refractoriness of pyramidal cells can be quantified. Observations of I-V curves during and in absence of refractoriness are cast into a model that is used to predict both the subthreshold response and spiking activity of the neuron to novel stimuli. The predictions of the resulting model are in excellent agreement with experimental data and close to the intrinsic neuronal reproducibility to repeated stimuli.},

This approach requires a notation for units that does not depend on the treatments applied. Most structure on the set of observational units, or on the set of treatments, can be defined by factors. This book develops a coherent framework for thinking about factors and their relationships, including the use of Hasse diagrams. These are used to elucidate structure, calculate degrees of freedom and allocate treatment subspaces to appropriate strata. Based on a one-term course the author has taught since 1989, the book is ideal for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses.

The technique, developed at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom, is being increasingly used for both clinical studies and basic research, with some 500 stimulators presently in use worldwide. This paper looks at the development of magnetic stimulation as a clinical tool. The basic physics principles of the technique are outlined, and the different magnetic field waveforms, coil geometrics, and orientations that can be used are discussed. The depth of penetration of magnetic stimulation is compared to that of conventional electrical stimulation using surface electrodes. It is shown that the former generates lower electric fields at the surface of the body, resulting in greater penetration and the ability to stimulate deep nerves without pain. Magnetic stimulation has several other advantages over electrical stimulation, including being able to stimulate the human brain without discomfort due to the magnetic fields passing through the skull without attenuation. These advantages, along with the limitations of the technique, are discussed. Finally, data relating to the safety of brain stimulation are summarised in terms of the electromagnetic parameters used. It is concluded that the present generation of magnetic stimulators do not cause acute hazards, provided their electrical and mechanical design meets the relevant electromedical safety standards.},

Across the frequency range of 10 Hz-10 kHz, room temperature conductivity was 1.45 S/m, but body temperature conductivity was 1.79 S/m, approximately 23{\%} higher. Modelers of electrical sources in the human brain have underestimated human CSF conductivity by as much as 44{\%} for nearly two decades, and this should be corrected to increase the accuracy of source localization models.},

 abstract = {In magnetic nanoparticle imaging, magnetic nanoparticles are coated and functionalized to bind to specific targets. After measuring their magnetic relaxation or remanence, their distribution can be determined by means of inverse methods. The reconstruction algorithm presented in this paper includes first a dipole fit using a Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer to determine the reconstruction plane. Secondly, a minimum norm estimate is obtained on a regular grid placed in that plane. Computer simulations involving different parameter sets and conditions show that the used approach allows for the reconstruction of distributed sources, although the reconstructed shapes are distorted by blurring effects. The reconstruction quality depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements and decreases with larger sensor-source distances and higher grid spacings. In phantom measurements, the magnetic remanence of nanoparticle columns with clinical relevant sizes is determined with two common measurement systems. The reconstructions from these measurements indicate that the approach is applicable for clinical measurements. Our results provide parameter sets for successful application of minimum norm approaches to Magnetic Nanoparticle Imaging.},

Combined with a peak resistance frequency method this allowed obtaining intrinsic resistivity values of brain tissues and structures with submillimetric resolution. Reproducible resistivity measurements are reported, which allows the resistivity in the cortex, ventricle, fiber tracts, thalamus and basal ganglia to be differentiated. Measurements of brain slices revealed resistivity profiles correlated with the local density of cell bodies hence allowing to discriminate between the different cortical layers. Finally, impedance measurements were performed on a model of cauterized mouse brain evidencing the possibility to measure the spatial extent and the degree of the tissue denaturation due to the cauterization.},

@article{Borghetti.2008,
 abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method to investigate motor pathways and to create a map of the somatotopical organization of the motor cortex: ordinary mapping procedures requires a focal brain stimulation over different spots of the scalp and electromyographic (EMG) recording from a muscle. Finding an appropriate and a valid visual representation of collected data is a crucial step in research and clinical field to allow a relatively fast, intra- and inter-patient comparison of motor cortex mapping. Aim of this study was to develop and to validate a method to map cortical representation of an intrinsic hand muscle (abductor digiti minimi, ADM) using a two-dimensional spline interpolation of EMG peak amplitudes obtained with TMS. The interpolated model will result in a graphical colour-scaled representation of the motor cortex for the investigated muscle; fitted model was finally validated by comparing derived parameters with those directly measured to ensure the strength and reliability of the model. Ten healthy volunteers (mean age+/-S.D.: 35.3+/-4.7 years, 4 males and 6 females) were enrolled in the study. Transcranial stimulation was performed by placing a figure-of-eight coil over a predefined grid on the scalp of the subject. EMG responses were recorded from the right abductor digiti minimi (ADM): averaged EMG peak amplitudes obtained at each node were then used to perform spline interpolation and to derive other parameters like center of gravity (CoG). Arithmetical mean of all resting motor threshold at the hotspot was 50.6+/-3.4{\%} of the maximal stimulator output. Average amplitude at the hotspot was 1.72+/-0.80 mV and its coordinates, expressed as median, were x=4.5 cm and y=0.0 cm. Mean CoG was located at x=4.86+/-0.57 cm and y=0.35+/-0.10 cm. Mean interpolated peak coordinates for ADM were xf=4.86+/-0.58 cm and yf=0.36+/-0.12 cm, while mean fitted peak amplitude was 0.87+/-0.47 mV. Results suggest how it is possible to map the primary motor cortex using two-dimensional spline interpolation of peak-to-peak amplitudes obtained by single pulse TMS delivered on several scalp positions, which will result in a smooth, easy to read, colour-scaled map. However, like other visual representation modalities, the interpolation should become complementary to traditional methods and not a substitute of a precise and accurate cortical motor mapping.},

@article{Bungert.2016,
 abstract = {Much of our knowledge on the physiological mechanisms of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stems from studies which targeted the human motor cortex. However, it is still unclear which part of the motor cortex is predominantly affected by TMS. Considering that the motor cortex consists of functionally and histologically distinct subareas, this also renders the hypotheses on the physiological TMS effects uncertain. We use the finite element method (FEM) and magnetic resonance image-based individual head models to get realistic estimates of the electric field induced by TMS. The field changes in different subparts of the motor cortex are compared with electrophysiological threshold changes of 2 hand muscles when systematically varying the coil orientation in measurements. We demonstrate that TMS stimulates the region around the gyral crown and that the maximal electric field strength in this region is significantly related to the electrophysiological response. Our study is one of the most extensive comparisons between FEM-based field calculations and physiological TMS effects so far, being based on data for 2 hand muscles in 9 subjects. The results help to improve our understanding of the basic mechanisms of TMS. They also pave the way for a systematic exploration of realistic field estimates for dosage control in TMS.},

@article{Burke.1993,
 abstract = {1. The effects of graded transcranial magnetic and anodal electrical stimulation of the human motor cortex were compared in human subjects undergoing orthopaedic operations on the spine, before and after withdrawal of volatile anaesthesia. Corticospinal volleys were recorded from the spinal cord in the low-cervical and low-thoracic regions (six subjects) or the mid-thoracic region (two subjects) using bipolar electrodes inserted into the epidural space. 2. Electrical stimuli were delivered using anode at the vertex and cathode 7 cm laterally. The corticospinal volley at threshold consisted of a single deflection with a mean latency to peak of 4.17 ms at the rostral recording site. With further increases in stimulus strength the latency of this D wave shortened in two steps, first by 0.89 ms (seven subjects) and then by a further 0.8 ms (two subjects), indicating that the site of activation of some corticospinal neurones had shifted to deep subcortical sites. 3. When volatile anaesthetics were given, a corticospinal volley could not be defined in three subjects with magnetic stimuli of 70, 80 and 100{\%} maximal stimulator output with the coil at the vertex (Novametrix Magstim 200, round coil, external diameter 14 cm). In the remaining five subjects, the component of lowest threshold was a D wave recorded at the rostral site at 4.0 ms when stimulus intensity was, on average, 70{\%}. With stimuli of 90-100{\%} a total of five small I waves could be defined in the five subjects (i.e. on average one I wave per subject). 4. After cessation of volatile anaesthetics in seven subjects, the thresholds for D and I waves were lower and their amplitudes were greater. The D wave remained the component of lowest threshold in all subjects, appearing at the low-cervical level with magnetic stimuli of 50{\%}. However, in three subjects I waves also appeared at D wave threshold, and the D wave was smaller than with electrical stimulation at I wave threshold. There was no consistent change in latency of the magnetic D wave as stimulus intensity was increased to 100{\%}. 5. These findings suggest that the previously reported difference in latency of the EMG potentials produced in upper-limb muscles by anodal stimulation and magnetic stimulation of the human motor cortex is not because the corticospinal volley induced by magnetic stimulation lacks a D wave.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@book{Campbell.1994,
 abstract = {This book is a comprehensive design text for permanent magnets and their application. Permanent magnets are very important industrially, and are widely used in a variety of applications, including industrial drives, consumer products, computers and automobiles.



In the early 1970s a new class of magnet - the rare earths - was discovered, the properties of which showed sustained improvement over the following two decades. New materials such as these have spawned many new markets for magnets, with significant performance gains in the devices for which they are used. By the early 1990s the new magnet technologies had matured.



Until the advent of the present book, however, there has been no text that unified all the relevant information on the wide range of modern permanent magnet materials. This book, therefore, has been written as a comprehensive review of the technology, intended for scientists and engineers involved in all stages of the manufacture, design and use of magnets. A brief theory of magnetism explains the behaviour of the different classes of permanent magnet, and the various production processes that lead to quite diverse material characteristics.



The core of the book is a detailed treatment of the methods that are used to design permanent magnets, including assessments of the changes they experience under practical operating conditions. Modern analytical techniques are described, including the finite element method, with reference to the accurate simulation of permanent magnet materials. With the evolution of new materials, the markets for permanent magnets have changed.



In this book, the author emphasizes the most important modern applications, and discusses the viability of the various magnet types that are now available. This book, the first to cover comprehensively all aspects of modern permanent magnet materials, their design and application, will be of value to anyone involved in the design and use of magnets.},

@article{Cao.2015,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

To predict signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) trends and absorbed energy in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain up to 14T.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A human head in an eight-channel transmit/receive coil was simulated with Maxwell and Bloch equations to determine excitation homogeneity with radiofrequency (RF) shimming, image homogeneity, SNR, and absorbed energy in MRI from 1.5 to 14T considering realistic field distributions and relaxation properties.

RESULTS

RF shimming alone achieved a standard deviation in excitation flip angle less than 10° in mid-brain up to 14T, but produced a small region with low excitation on a lower slice. Current reconstruction methods may produce shading artifacts at 14T. SNR increases with a greater-than-linear rate for gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequences having short (2 msec) echo time (TE) and long relaxation time (TR) ($\sim$2.3-fold increase from 7T to 14T), but a less-than-linear rate if TE is 10 msec ($\sim$1.6-fold increase from 7T to 14T). Depending on the sequence, SNR per square root of imaging time may produce a less-than-linear increase with B0 . Whole-head absorbed energy shows a less-than-quadratic increase with B0 (1.7-fold increase from 7T to 14T).

CONCLUSION

Numerical simulations indicate that with proper preparation and precautions, imaging of the human brain at up to 14T could be performed safely, with advantages in SNR.},

 abstract = {The results of brain connectivity analysis using reconstructed source time courses derived from EEG and MEG data depend on a number of algorithmic choices. While previous studies have investigated the influence of the choice of source estimation method or connectivity measure, the effects of the head modeling errors or simplifications have not been studied sufficiently. In the present simulation study, we investigated the influence of particular properties of the head model on the reconstructed source time courses as well as on source connectivity analysis in EEG and MEG. Therefore, we constructed a realistic head model and applied the finite element method to solve the EEG and MEG forward problems. We considered the distinction between white and gray matter, the distinction between compact and spongy bone, the inclusion of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment, and the reduction to a simple 3-layer model comprising only the skin, skull, and brain. Source time courses were reconstructed using a beamforming approach and the source connectivity was estimated by the imaginary coherence (ICoh) and the generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC). Our results show that in both EEG and MEG, neglecting the white and gray matter distinction or the CSF causes considerable errors in reconstructed source time courses and connectivity analysis, while the distinction between spongy and compact bone is just of minor relevance, provided that an adequate skull conductivity value is used. Large inverse and connectivity errors are found in the same regions that show large topography errors in the forward solution. Moreover, we demonstrate that the very conservative ICoh is relatively safe from the crosstalk effects caused by imperfect head models, as opposed to the GPDC.},

 abstract = {The inverse scattering problem is central to many areas of science and technology such as radar and sonar, medical imaging, geophysical exploration and nondestructive testing. This book is devoted to the mathematical and numerical analysis of the inverse scattering problem for acoustic and electromagnetic waves. In this third edition, new sections have been added on the linear sampling and factorization methods for solving the inverse scattering problem as well as expanded treatments of iteration methods and uniqueness theorems for the inverse obstacle problem. These additions have in turn required an expanded presentation of both transmission eigenvalues and boundary integral equations in Sobolev spaces. As in the previous editions, emphasis has been given to simplicity over generality thus providing the reader with an accessible introduction to the field of inverse scattering theory.Review of earlier editions:~``Colton and Kress have written a scholarly, state of the art account of their view of direct and inverse scattering. The book is a pleasure to read as a graduate text or to dip into at leisure. It suggests a number of open problems and will be a source of inspiration for many years to come.''SIAM Review, September 1994~~``This book should be on the desk of any researcher, any student, any teacher interested in scattering theory.''Mathematical Intelligencer, June 1994},

@article{Cona.2011,
 abstract = {Knowledge of cortical rhythms represents an important aspect of modern neuroscience, to understand how the brain realizes its functions. Recent data suggest that different regions in the brain may exhibit distinct electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms when perturbed by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and that these rhythms can change due to the connectivity among regions. In this context, in silico simulations may help the validation of these hypotheses that would be difficult to be verified in vivo. Neural mass models can be very useful to simulate specific aspects of electrical brain activity and, above all, to analyze and identify the overall frequency content of EEG in a cortical region of interest (ROI). In this work we implemented a model of connectivity among cortical regions to fit the impulse responses in three ROIs recorded during a series of TMS/EEG experiments performed in five subjects and using three different impulse intensities. In particular we investigated Brodmann Area (BA) 19 (occipital lobe), BA 7 (parietal lobe) and BA 6 (frontal lobe). Results show that the model can reproduce the natural rhythms of the three regions quite well, acting on a few internal parameters. Moreover, the model can explain most rhythm changes induced by stimulation of another region, and inter-subject variability, by estimating just a few long-range connectivity parameters among ROIs.},

Albeit a framework that is limited to coarse-grained or mean-field activity, neural field models provide a framework for unifying data from different imaging modalities. Starting with a description of neural mass models, we build to spatially extend cortical models of layered two-dimensional sheets with long range axonal connections mediating synaptic interactions. Reformulations of the fundamental non-local mathematical model in terms of more familiar local differential (brain wave) equations are described. Techniques for the analysis of such models, including how to determine the onset of spatio-temporal pattern forming instabilities, are reviewed. Extensions of the basic formalism to treat refractoriness, adaptive feedback and inhomogeneous connectivity are described along with open challenges for the development of multi-scale models that can integrate macroscopic models at large spatial scales with models at the microscopic scale.},

This technique circumvents the discretizing of complicated gradient coil geometries into a mesh of Yee cells, and thereby enables any type of gradient coil modeling or other complex low frequency sources. The proposed method has been verified against an example with an analytical solution.

@article{David.2006,
 abstract = {Neuronally plausible, generative or forward models are essential for understanding how event-related fields (ERFs) and potentials (ERPs) are generated. In this paper, we present a new approach to modeling event-related responses measured with EEG or MEG. This approach uses a biologically informed model to make inferences about the underlying neuronal networks generating responses. The approach can be regarded as a neurobiologically constrained source reconstruction scheme, in which the parameters of the reconstruction have an explicit neuronal interpretation. Specifically, these parameters encode, among other things, the coupling among sources and how that coupling depends upon stimulus attributes or experimental context. The basic idea is to supplement conventional electromagnetic forward models, of how sources are expressed in measurement space, with a model of how source activity is generated by neuronal dynamics. A single inversion of this extended forward model enables inference about both the spatial deployment of sources and the underlying neuronal architecture generating them. Critically, this inference covers long-range connections among well-defined neuronal subpopulations. In a previous paper, we simulated ERPs using a hierarchical neural-mass model that embodied bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections among remote regions. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian procedure to estimate the parameters of this model using empirical data. We demonstrate this procedure by characterizing the role of changes in cortico-cortical coupling, in the genesis of ERPs. In the first experiment, ERPs recorded during the perception of faces and houses were modeled as distinct cortical sources in the ventral visual pathway. Category-selectivity, as indexed by the face-selective N170, could be explained by category-specific differences in forward connections from sensory to higher areas in the ventral stream. We were able to quantify and make inferences about these effects using conditional estimates of connectivity. This allowed us to identify where, in the processing stream, category-selectivity emerged. In the second experiment, we used an auditory oddball paradigm to show that the mismatch negativity can be explained by changes in connectivity. Specifically, using Bayesian model selection, we assessed changes in backward connections, above and beyond changes in forward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions, there was strong evidence for learning-related changes in both forward and backward coupling. These examples show that category- or context-specific coupling among cortical regions can be assessed explicitly, within a mechanistic, biologically motivated inference framework.},

@article{Deco.2008,
 abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space-time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

@article{DiLazzaro.1999,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To assess the diagnostic usefulness of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and to identify the optimal method for calculating the central conduction time. The test results were evaluated in a prospective study of 1023 neurological patients.

METHODS

We evaluated the correlation between clinical and electrophysiological findings, the accuracy, the sensitivity, the percentage of subclinical abnormalities and the false negative rates of MEPs in different neurological disorders. In patients with lower motor neuron involvement, we compared the central conduction time calculated as the difference between the latency of the cortical and magnetic root stimulation responses with that calculated using the F-wave method.

RESULTS

The agreement index between electrophysiological and clinical findings was 87{\%}. The overall accuracy of the test was 0.97. The higher sensitivity values were demonstrated in spinal cord disorders (0.85), hereditary spastic paraplegia (0.80) and motor neuron diseases (0.74). The higher percentages of subclinical abnormalities were found in motor neuron disorders (26{\%}) muscular diseases (24{\%}), multiple sclerosis (13.5{\%}) and spinal cord diseases (12.5{\%}). The higher false negative rates were found in sylvian stroke (0.36) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (0.16). Central conduction study using magnetic paravertebral stimulation but not using the F-wave method, resulted in 12{\%} and 10{\%} of false positive values in lower limb multiradiculopathies and in neuropathies, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS

MEPs represent a highly accurate diagnostic test. MEP clinical value is maximum in motor neuron, muscle and spinal cord diseases. In patients with lower motor neuron involvement, the gold standard for central conduction determination is the F-wave method.},

@article{DiLazzaro.2012,
 abstract = {The human motor cortex can be activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoking a high-frequency repetitive discharge of corticospinal neurones. The exact physiologic mechanisms producing the corticospinal activity still remain unclear because of the complexity of the interactions between the currents induced in the brain and the circuits of cerebral cortex, composed of multiple excitatory and inhibitory neurons and axons of different size, location, orientation and function. The aim of current paper is to evaluate whether the main characteristics of the activity evoked by single- and paired-pulse and repetitive TMS, can be accounted by the interaction of the induced currents in the brain with the key anatomic features of a simple cortical circuit composed of the superficial population of excitatory pyramidal neurons of layers II and III, the large pyramidal neurons in layer V, and the inhibitory GABA cells. This circuit represents the minimum architecture necessary for capturing the most essential cortical input-output operations of neocortex. The interaction between the induced currents in the brain and this simple model of cortical circuitry might explain the characteristics and nature of the repetitive discharge evoked by TMS, including its regular and rhythmic nature and its dose-dependency and pharmacologic modulation. The integrative properties of the circuit also provide a good framework for the interpretation of the changes in the cortical output produced by paired and repetitive TMS.},

@article{DiLazzaro.2013,
 abstract = {Although transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) activates a number of different neuron types in the cortex, the final output elicited in corticospinal neurones is surprisingly stereotyped. A single TMS pulse evokes a series of descending corticospinal volleys that are separated from each other by about 1.5 ms (i.e., {\~{}}670 Hz). This evoked descending corticospinal activity can be directly recorded by an epidural electrode placed over the high cervical cord. The earliest wave is thought to originate from the direct activation of the axons of fast-conducting pyramidal tract neurones (PTN) and is therefore termed {\dq}D{\dq} wave. The later waves are thought to originate from indirect, trans-synaptic activation of PTNs and are termed {\dq}I{\dq} waves. The anatomical and computational characteristics of a canonical microcircuit model of cerebral cortex composed of layer II and III and layer V excitatory pyramidal cells, inhibitory interneurons, and cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical inputs can account for the main characteristics of the corticospinal activity evoked by TMS including its regular and rhythmic nature, the stimulus intensity-dependence and its pharmacological modulation. In this review we summarize present knowledge of the physiological basis of the effects of TMS of the human motor cortex describing possible interactions between TMS and simple canonical microcircuits of neocortex. According to the canonical model, a TMS pulse induces strong depolarization of the excitatory cells in the superficial layers of the circuit. This leads to highly synchronized recruitment of clusters of excitatory neurons, including layer V PTNs, and of inhibitory interneurons producing a high frequency ({\~{}}670 Hz) repetitive discharge of the corticospinal axons. The role of the inhibitory circuits is crucial to entrain the firing of the excitatory networks to produce a high-frequency discharge and to control the number and magnitude of evoked excitatory discharge in layer V PTNs. In summary, simple canonical microcircuits of neocortex can explain activation of corticospinal neurons in human motor cortex by TMS.},

@article{DiLazzaro.2014,
 abstract = {A number of methods have been developed recently that stimulate the human brain non-invasively through the intact scalp. The most common are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electric stimulation (TES) and transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS). They are widely used to probe function and connectivity of brain areas as well as therapeutically in a variety of conditions such as depression or stroke. They are much less focal than conventional invasive methods which use small electrodes placed on or in the brain and are often thought to activate all classes of neurones in the stimulated area. However, this is not true. A large body of evidence from experiments on the motor cortex shows that non-invasive methods of brain stimulation can be surprisingly selective and that adjusting the intensity and direction of stimulation can activate different classes of inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the corticospinal output cells. Here we review data that have elucidated the action of TMS and TES, concentrating mainly on the most direct evidence available from spinal epidural recordings of the descending corticospinal volleys. The results show that it is potentially possible to test and condition specific neural circuits in motor cortex that could be affected differentially by disease, or be used in different forms of natural behaviour. However, there is substantial interindividual variability in the specificity of these protocols. Perhaps in the future it will be possible, with the advances currently being made to model the electrical fields induced in individual brains, to develop forms of stimulation that can reliably target more specific populations of neurones, and open up the internal circuitry of the motor cortex for study in behaving humans.},

The objective of this work was to identify source grid parameters that provide a good condition for the related linear inverse problem. The parameters investigated here were the number of sources, the extension of the source grid, and the source direction. A new measure of the condition, the ratio between the largest and mean singular value of the lead field matrix, is proposed. Our results indicated that the source grids should be larger than the sensor area. The sources and, consequently, the magnetic excitation field, should be directed toward the Z-direction. For underdetermined linear inverse problems, such as in our application, the number of sources affects the condition to a relatively small degree. Overdetermined magnetostatic linear inverse problems, however, benefit from a reduction in the number of sources, which considerably improves the condition. The adapted source grids proposed here were used to estimate the magnetostatic dipole from simulated data; the L2-norm, residual, and distances between the estimated and simulated sources were significantly reduced.},

 abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is commonly used to activate or inactivate specific cortical areas in a noninvasive manner. Because of technical constraints, the precise effects of TMS on cortical circuits are difficult to assess experimentally. Here, this issue is investigated by constructing a detailed model of a portion of the thalamocortical system and examining the effects of the simulated delivery of a TMS pulse. The model, which incorporates a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints, includes 33,000 spiking neurons arranged in a 3-layered motor cortex and over 5 million intra- and interlayer synaptic connections. The model was validated by reproducing several results from the experimental literature. These include the frequency, timing, dose response, and pharmacological modulation of epidurally recorded responses to TMS (the so-called I-waves), as well as paired-pulse response curves consistent with data from several experimental studies. The modeled responses to simulated TMS pulses in different experimental paradigms provide a detailed, self-consistent account of the neural and synaptic activities evoked by TMS within prototypical cortical circuits.},

Although it is well known that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) excites cerebral cortex in an orientation-selective manner, a neurophysiologically compelling explanation of this phenomenon has been lacking. It is generally presumed that TMS-induced excitation is mediated by horizontal fibers in the cortical surfaces nearest to the stimulating coil, i.e., at the gyral crowns. No evidence exists, however, that horizontal fibers are orientation selective either anatomically or physiologically. We used positron emission tomography to demonstrate that TMS-induced cortical activation is selectively sulcal. This observation allows the well-established columnar organization of cerebral cortex to be invoked to explain the observed orientation selectivity. In addition, Rushton's cosine principle can used to model stimulation efficacy for an electrical field applied at any cortical site at any intensity and in any orientation.},

Digital systems, however complex and intelligent they might be, must receive information from the outside world that is generally analog and not electrical. Sensors are interface devices between various physical values and the electronic circuits who 'understand' only a language of moving electrical charges. In other words, sensors are the eyes, ears, and noses of silicon chips. Unlike other books on sensors, this book is organized according to the measured variables (temperature, pressure, position, etc.) that make it much more practical and easier to read. In this new edition recent ideas and developments have been added while less important and non-essential designs were dropped. Sections on practical designs and use of the modern micro-machining technologies have been revised substantially. This book is a reference text that can be used by students, researchers interested in modern instrumentation (applied physicists and engineers), sensor designers, application engineers and technicians whose job it is to understand, select and/or design sensors for practical systems{\dq}--Provided by publisher.},

 abstract = {In neurology, as in all branches of medicine, symptoms of disease and the resulting burden of illness and disability are not simply the consequence of the injury, inflammation or dysfunction of a given organ; they also reflect the consequences of the nervous system's attempt to adapt to the insult. This plastic response includes compensatory changes that prove adaptive for the individual, as well as changes that contribute to functional disability and are, therefore, maladaptive. In this context, brain stimulation techniques tailored to modulate individual plastic changes associated with neurological diseases might enhance clinical benefits and minimize adverse effects. In this Review, we discuss the use of two noninvasive brain stimulation techniques--repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation--to modulate activity in the targeted cortex or in a dysfunctional network, to restore an adaptive equilibrium in a disrupted network for best behavioral outcome, and to suppress plastic changes for functional advantage. We review randomized controlled studies, in focal epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, recovery from stroke, and chronic pain, to illustrate these principles, and we present evidence for the clinical effects of these two techniques.},

The procedure conforms to an EM implementation of a Gauss-Newton search for the maximum of the conditional or posterior density. The inclusion of priors in the estimation procedure ensures robust and rapid convergence and the resulting conditional densities enable Bayesian inference about the model parameters. The method is demonstrated using an input-state-output model of the hemodynamic coupling between experimentally designed causes or factors in fMRI studies and the ensuing BOLD response. This example represents a generalization of current fMRI analysis models that accommodates nonlinearities and in which the parameters have an explicit physical interpretation. Second, the approach extends classical inference, based on the likelihood of the data given a null hypothesis about the parameters, to more plausible inferences about the parameters of the model given the data. This inference provides for confidence intervals based on the conditional density.},

These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles. We refer to this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM).},

It builds on the distinction between models of the brain as a computational machine and computational models of neuronal dynamics per se; i.e., models of brain function and biophysics. Both sorts of model borrow heavily from computational neuroscience, and both have enriched the analysis of neuroimaging data and the type of questions we address. To illustrate the role of functional models in imaging neuroscience, we focus on optimal control and decision (game) theory; the models used here provide a mechanistic account of neuronal computations and the latent (mental) states represent by the brain. In terms of biophysical modelling, we focus on dynamic causal modelling, with a special emphasis on recent advances in neural-mass models for hemodynamic and electrophysiological time series. Each example emphasises the role of generative models, which embed our hypotheses or questions, and the importance of model comparison (i.e., hypothesis testing). We will refer to this theme, when trying to contextualise recent trends in relation to each other.},

Two classes of minimum norm solutions are examined: linear least squares methods and nonlinear L1-norm approaches. Two special cases of linear algorithms, the well known Minimum Norm Least Squares and an implementation with Laplacian smoothness constraints, are compared to two nonlinear algorithms comprising sparse and standard L1-norm methods. In a signal-to-noise-ratio framework, two of the methods allow automatic determination of the optimum regularization parameter. Compensation methods for the different depth dependencies of all approaches by lead-field normalization are discussed. Simulations with tangentially and radially oriented test dipoles at two different noise levels are performed to reveal and compare the properties of all approaches. Finally, cortically constrained versions of the algorithms are applied to two epileptic spike data sets and compared to results of single equivalent dipole fits and spatiotemporal source models.},

 abstract = {This thesis is a contribution to the design of electrical capacitance

tomography (ECT) systems with compact construction for a specific class of

simple industrial applications. The intention is the first design and

implementation of a tomographic sensor system utilizing the

three-electrodes measuring principle based on developed design guidelines.

The investigations are focussing on image reconstruction and position

determination of dielectric reference objects in a confined detection area.

In spite of a special circuit design, which is applicable to measuring

multiple sensor channels simultaneously with different sensitivity, low

electromagnetic susceptibility and without mutual interference, the

three-electrodes principle was not yet been investigated for applications

in the field of ECT. The aim of the work are specific design rules for a

square cross-sectional and constructively simplified ECT sensor, which can

be derived from a systematic analysis of the influence of different sensor

parameters especially on the image quality, taking into account of the used

measuring principle's characteristics. Through an efficient reconstruction

algorithm and a suitable localisation algorithm, basic requirements for

real-time measurements even in limited computing resources are furthermore

established. The studies carried out with the developed experimental system

consisting of an optimised sensor configuration and a computer program as

well as a modular measurement electronics with switching network show that

this approach is generally suitable for the targeted applications. The

capability and limitations of the system components are described in

detail, and necessary means of realising real-time applications are

presented. Therefore the three-electrodes principle appears to be a

promisingtechnology for the development of compact and cost-feasible ECT

sensor systems with a robust and powerful capacitive measurement

@article{Geeter.2015,
 abstract = {In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), an applied alternating magnetic field induces an electric field in the brain that can interact with the neural system. It is generally assumed that this induced electric field is the crucial effect exciting a certain region of the brain. More specifically, it is the component of this field parallel to the neuron's local orientation, the so-called effective electric field, that can initiate neuronal stimulation. Deeper insights on the stimulation mechanisms can be acquired through extensive TMS modelling. Most models study simple representations of neurons with assumed geometries, whereas we embed realistic neural trajectories computed using tractography based on diffusion tensor images. This way of modelling ensures a more accurate spatial distribution of the effective electric field that is in addition patient and case specific. The case study of this paper focuses on the single pulse stimulation of the left primary motor cortex with a standard figure-of-eight coil. Including realistic neural geometry in the model demonstrates the strong and localized variations of the effective electric field between the tracts themselves and along them due to the interplay of factors such as the tract's position and orientation in relation to the TMS coil, the neural trajectory and its course along the white and grey matter interface. Furthermore, the influence of changes in the coil orientation is studied. Investigating the impact of tissue anisotropy confirms that its contribution is not negligible. Moreover, assuming isotropic tissues lead to errors of the same size as rotating or tilting the coil with 10 degrees. In contrast, the model proves to be less sensitive towards the not well-known tissue conductivity values.},

 abstract = {When delivered over a specific cortical site, TMS can temporarily disrupt the ongoing process in that area. This allows mapping of speech-related areas for preoperative evaluation purposes. We numerically explore the observed variability of TMS responses during a speech mapping experiment performed with a neuronavigation system. We selected four cases with very small perturbations in coil position and orientation. In one case (E) a naming error occurred, while in the other cases (NEA, B, C) the subject appointed the images as smoothly as without TMS. A realistic anisotropic head model was constructed of the subject from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI. The induced electric field distributions were computed, associated to the coil parameters retrieved from the neuronavigation system. Finally, the membrane potentials along relevant white matter fibre tracts, extracted from DTI-based tractography, were computed using a compartmental cable equation. While only minor differences could be noticed between the induced electric field distributions of the four cases, computing the corresponding membrane potentials revealed different subsets of tracts were activated. A single tract was activated for all coil positions. Another tract was only triggered for case E. NEA induced action potentials in 13 tracts, while NEB stimulated 11 tracts and NEC one. The calculated results are certainly sensitive to the coil specifications, demonstrating the observed variability in this study. However, even though a tract connecting Broca's with Wernicke's area is only triggered for the error case, further research is needed on other study cases and on refining the neural model with synapses and network connections. Case- and subject-specific modelling that includes both electromagnetic fields and neuronal activity enables demonstration of the variability in TMS experiments and can capture the interaction with complex neural networks.},

For these optimization techniques to be exploited effectively, problem solvers need to be fully informed of the scope and organization of software for both the specialist and non-specialist; the underlying numerical methods; the aspects of problem formulation that affect performance; the assessment of computer results and the resolution of difficulties that may occur during the solution process. These topics form the basis of the organization of Practical Optimization. Much of the material about the estimation of results and the preparation of the problem has not been previously published. The book contains a description of methods for numerical optimization to a level which should make it a useful course text. It is intended that the book should be self-contained. Consequently, those elements of calculus, linear algebra and numerical analysis pertinent to optimization are reviewed in the opening chapters. This is the first book on optimization which discusses not only the methods but also the analysis of computed results and the preparation of problems before solution.},

@article{Goetz.2014,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) play a pivotal role in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), e.g., for determining the motor threshold and probing cortical excitability. Sampled across the range of stimulation strengths, MEPs outline an input-output (IO) curve, which is often used to characterize the corticospinal tract. More detailed understanding of the signal generation and variability of MEPs would provide insight into the underlying physiology and aid correct statistical treatment of MEP data.

METHODS

A novel regression model is tested using measured IO data of twelve subjects. The model splits MEP variability into two independent contributions, acting on both sides of a strong sigmoidal nonlinearity that represents neural recruitment. Traditional sigmoidal regression with a single variability source after the nonlinearity is used for comparison.

RESULTS

The distribution of MEP amplitudes varied across different stimulation strengths, violating statistical assumptions in traditional regression models. In contrast to the conventional regression model, the dual variability source model better described the IO characteristics including phenomena such as changing distribution spread and skewness along the IO curve.

CONCLUSIONS

MEP variability is best described by two sources that most likely separate variability in the initial excitation process from effects occurring later on. The new model enables more accurate and sensitive estimation of the IO curve characteristics, enhancing its power as a detection tool, and may apply to other brain stimulation modalities. Furthermore, it extracts new information from the IO data concerning the neural variability-information that has previously been treated as noise.},

@article{Gomez.2015,
 abstract = {A computational framework for uncertainty quantification in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is presented. The framework leverages high dimensional model representations (HDMRs), which approximate observables (i.e. quantities of interest such as electric (E) fields induced inside targeted cortical regions) via series of iteratively constructed component functions involving only the most significant random variables (i.e. parameters that characterize the uncertainty in a TMS setup such as the position and orientation of TMS coils, as well as the size, shape, and conductivity of the head tissue). The component functions of HDMR expansions are approximated via a multi-element probabilistic collocation (ME-PC) method. While approximating each component function, a quasi-static finite difference simulator is used to compute observables at integration/collocation points dictated by the ME-PC method. The proposed framework requires far fewer simulations than traditional Monte Carlo methods for providing highly accurate statistical information (e.g., the mean and standard deviation) about the observables. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework are demonstrated via its application to the statistical characterization of E-fields generated by TMS inside cortical regions of an MRI-derived realistic head model. Numerical results show that while uncertainties in tissue conductivities have negligible effects on TMS operation, variations in coil position/orientation and brain size significantly affect the induced E-fields. Our numerical results have several implications for the use of TMS during depression therapy: (i) uncertainty in the coil position and orientation may reduce the response rates of patients, (ii) practitioners should favor targets on the crest of a gyrus to obtain maximal stimulation, and (iii) an increasing scalp-to-cortex distance reduces the magnitude of Efields on the surface and inside the cortex.},

 abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dispersive tissue properties on the volume-conducted voltage waveforms and volume of tissue activated during deep brain stimulation. Inhomogeneous finite-element models were developed, incorporating a distributed dispersive electrode-tissue interface and encapsulation tissue of high and low conductivity, under both current-controlled and voltage-controlled stimulation. The models were used to assess the accuracy of capacitive models, where material properties were estimated at a single frequency, with respect to the full dispersive models. The effect of incorporating dispersion in the electrical conductivity and relative permittivity was found to depend on both the applied stimulus and the encapsulation tissue surrounding the electrode. Under current-controlled stimulation, and during voltage-controlled stimulation when the electrode was surrounded by high-resistivity encapsulation tissue, the dispersive material properties of the tissue were found to influence the voltage waveform in the tissue, indicated by RMS errors between the capacitive and dispersive models of 20{\%}-38{\%} at short pulse durations. When the dispersive model was approximated by a capacitive model, the accuracy of estimates of the volume of tissue activated was very sensitive to the frequency at which material properties were estimated. When material properties at 1 kHz were used, the error in the volume of tissue activated by capacitive approximations was reduced to -4.33{\%} and 11.10{\%}, respectively, for current-controlled and voltage-controlled stimulations, with higher errors observed when higher or lower frequencies were used.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The aim of electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization is to find the brain areas responsible for EEG waves of interest. It consists of solving forward and inverse problems. The forward problem is solved by starting from a given electrical source and calculating the potentials at the electrodes. These evaluations are necessary to solve the inverse problem which is defined as finding brain sources which are responsible for the measured potentials at the EEG electrodes.

METHODS

While other reviews give an extensive summary of the both forward and inverse problem, this review article focuses on different aspects of solving the forward problem and it is intended for newcomers in this research field.

RESULTS

It starts with focusing on the generators of the EEG: the post-synaptic potentials in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. These cells generate an extracellular current which can be modeled by Poisson's differential equation, and Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The compartments in which these currents flow can be anisotropic (e.g. skull and white matter). In a three-shell spherical head model an analytical expression exists to solve the forward problem. During the last two decades researchers have tried to solve Poisson's equation in a realistically shaped head model obtained from 3D medical images, which requires numerical methods. The following methods are compared with each other: the boundary element method (BEM), the finite element method (FEM) and the finite difference method (FDM). In the last two methods anisotropic conducting compartments can conveniently be introduced. Then the focus will be set on the use of reciprocity in EEG source localization. It is introduced to speed up the forward calculations which are here performed for each electrode position rather than for each dipole position. Solving Poisson's equation utilizing FEM and FDM corresponds to solving a large sparse linear system. Iterative methods are required to solve these sparse linear systems. The following iterative methods are discussed: successive over-relaxation, conjugate gradients method and algebraic multigrid method.

CONCLUSION

Solving the forward problem has been well documented in the past decades. In the past simplified spherical head models are used, whereas nowadays a combination of imaging modalities are used to accurately describe the geometry of the head model. Efforts have been done on realistically describing the shape of the head model, as well as the heterogenity of the tissue types and realistically determining the conductivity. However, the determination and validation of the in vivo conductivity values is still an important topic in this field. In addition, more studies have to be done on the influence of all the parameters of the head model and of the numerical techniques on the solution of the forward problem.},

@article{Hallez.2008,
 abstract = {To improve the EEG source localization in the brain, the conductivities used in the head model play a very important role. In this study, we focus on the modeling of the anisotropic conductivity of the white matter. The anisotropic conductivity profile can be derived from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI). However, deriving these anisotropic conductivities from diffusion weighted MR images of the white matter is not straightforward. In the literature, two methods can be found for calculating the conductivity from the diffusion weighted images. One method uses a fixed value for the ratio of the conductivity in different directions, while the other method uses a conductivity profile obtained from a linear scaling of the diffusion ellipsoid. We propose a model which can be used to derive the conductivity profile from the diffusion tensor images. This model is based on the variable anisotropic ratio throughout the white matter and is a combination of the linear relationship as stated in the literature, with a constraint on the magnitude of the conductivity tensor (also known as the volume constraint). This approach is stated in the paper as approach A. In our study we want to investigate dipole estimation differences due to using a more simplified model for white matter anisotropy (approach B), while the electrode potentials are derived using a head model with a more realistic approach for the white matter anisotropy (approach A). We used a realistic head model, in which the forward problem was solved using a finite difference method that can incorporate anisotropic conductivities. As error measures we considered the dipole location error and the dipole orientation error. The results show that the dipole location errors are all below 10 mm and have an average of 4 mm in gray matter regions. The dipole orientation errors ranged up to 66.4 degrees, and had a mean of, on average, 11.6 degrees in gray matter regions. In a qualitative manner, the results show that the orientation and location error is dependent on the orientation of the test dipole. The location error is larger when the orientation of the test dipole is similar to the orientation of the anisotropy, while the orientation error is larger when the orientation of the test dipole deviates from the orientation of the anisotropy. From these results, we can conclude that the modeling of white matter anisotropy plays an important role in EEG source localization. More specifically, accurate source localization will require an accurate modeling of the white matter conductivity profile in each voxel.},

 abstract = {The electrophysiology of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex is not well understood. In this study, we investigate several structural parameters of the corticospinal tract and their relation to the TMS motor threshold (MT) in 17 subjects, with and without schizophrenia. We obtained structural and diffusion tensor MRI scans and measured the fractional anisotropy and principal diffusion direction for regions of interest in the corticospinal tract. We also measured the skull-to-cortex distance over the left motor region. The anterior-posterior trajectory of principle diffusion direction of the corticospinal tract and skull-to-cortex distance were both found to be highly correlated with MT, while fractional anisotropy, age and schizophrenia status were not. Two parameters-skull-to-cortex distance and the anterior component of the principle diffusion direction of the corticospinal tract as it passes the internal capsule-are highly predictive of MT in a linear regression model, and account for 82{\%} of the variance observed (R2 = 0.82, F = 20.27, P {\textless} 0.0001) in measurements of MT. The corticospinal tract's anterior-posterior direction alone contributes 13{\%} of the variance explained.},

 abstract = {Transcranial electric stimulation aims to stimulate the brain by applying weak electrical currents at the scalp. However, the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields in the human brain are unknown. We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.4 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.89) and depth (r = 0.84) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with in vivo intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials.},

@article{Ilmoniemi.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The behavior of the dendritic or axonal membrane voltage due to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often modeled with the one-dimensional cable equation. For the cable equation, a length constant lambda0 is defined; lambda0 describes the axial decay of the membrane voltage in the case of constant applied electric field. In TMS, however, the induced electric field waveform is typically a segment of a sinusoidal wave, with characteristic frequencies of the order of several kHz. OBJECTIVE: To show that the high frequency content of the stimulation pulse causes deviations in the spatial profile of the membrane voltage as compared to the steady state. METHODS: We derive the cable equation in complex form utilizing the complex frequency-dependent representation of the membrane conductivity. In addition, we define an effective length constant lambdaeff, which governs the spatial decay of the membrane voltage. We model the behavior of a dendrite in an applied electric field oscillating at 3.9 kHz with the complex cable equation and by solving the traditional cable equation numerically. RESULTS: The effective length constant decreases as a function of frequency. For a model dendrite or axon, for which lambda0 = 1.5 mm, the effective length constant at 3.9 kHz is decreased by a factor 10 to 0.13 mm. CONCLUSION: The frequency dependency of the neuronal length constant has to be taken into account when predicting the spatial behavior of the membrane voltage as a response to TMS.},

A quality control of machines subsequent to manufacturing is therefore required in order to test whether the machines comply with its specifications. This paper aims to describe the consideration of rotor tolerances due to non-ideal manufacturing processes. Design/methodology/approach -- Various fault scenarios are studied employing numerical field simulations focusing the influence of rotor tolerances on current and back-EMF of the studied machine. Findings -- This analysis shows that electrical quantities are applicable to realize tolerance diagnosis by evaluating the influence of non-ideal manufactured rotor components on the back-EMF and current characteristics of the studied machine. Practical implications -- This study provides an approach how to estimate the influence of the manufacturing tolerances for realization of a reliable quality control. This is useful to ensure a high reliability of the manufactured machines. Originality/value -- This paper gives a close insight on how to investigate non-ideal manufacturing and in particular its influence on the stator current.},

 abstract = {Until today, brain tumors especially glioblastoma are difficult to treat and therefore, results in a poor survival rate of 0-14{\%} over five years. To overcome this problem, the development of novel therapeutics as well as optimization of neurosurgical procedures to remove the tumor tissue are subject of intensive research. The main problem of the tumor excision, as the primary clinical intervention is the diffuse infiltration of the tumor cells in unaltered brain tissue that complicates the complete removal of residual tumor cells. In this context, we are developing novel approaches for the label-free discrimination between tumor tissue and unaltered brain tissue in real-time during the surgical process. Using our impedance spectroscopy-based measurement system in combination with flexible microelectrode arrays we could successfully demonstrate the discrimination between a C6-glioma and unaltered brain tissue in an in vivo rat model. The analysis of the impedance spectra revealed specific impedance spectrum shape characteristics of physiologic neuronal tissue in the frequency range of 10-500 kHz that were significantly different from the tumor tissue. Moreover, we used an adapted equivalent circuit model to get a deeper understanding for the nature of the observed effects. The impedimetric label-free and real-time discrimination of tumor from unaltered brain tissue offers the possibility for the implementation in surgical instruments to support surgeons to decide, which tissue areas should be removed and which should be remained.},

@article{Janssen.2015,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) depends highly on the coil orientation relative to the subject's head. This implies that the direction of the induced electric field has a large effect on the efficiency of TMS. To improve future protocols, knowledge about the relationship between the coil orientation and the direction of the induced electric field on the one hand, and the head and brain anatomy on the other hand, seems crucial. Therefore, the induced electric field in the cortex as a function of the coil orientation has been examined in this study. METHODS: The effect of changing the coil orientation on the induced electric field was evaluated for fourteen cortical targets. We used a finite element model to calculate the induced electric fields for thirty-six coil orientations (10 degrees resolution) per target location. The effects on the electric field due to coil rotation, in combination with target site anatomy, have been quantified. RESULTS: The results confirm that the electric field perpendicular to the anterior sulcal wall of the central sulcus is highly susceptible to coil orientation changes and has to be maximized for an optimal stimulation effect of the motor cortex. In order to obtain maximum stimulation effect in areas other than the motor cortex, the electric field perpendicular to the cortical surface in those areas has to be maximized as well. Small orientation changes (10 degrees) do not alter the induced electric field drastically. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that for all cortical targets, maximizing the strength of the electric field perpendicular to the targeted cortical surface area (and inward directed) optimizes the effect of TMS. Orienting the TMS coil based on anatomical information (anatomical magnetic resonance imaging data) about the targeted brain area can improve future results. The standard coil orientations, used in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, induce (near) optimal electric fields in the subject-specific head model in most cases.},

 abstract = {Switched reluctance motors (SRM) possess several superiorities such as

simplicity in structure, ruggedness, and good reliability, which make

it viable for the transportation applications. In this paper, an

axial-flux disk-type switched reluctance motor (DSRM) for hybrid

scooters is proposed. The DSRM can be used to drive the scooter and as

an engine starter simultaneously. Moreover, the torque density of axial

flux motors is more superior to that of radial flux motors in this

application. Instead of utilizing FEM, the permeance model is employed

to model the DSRM. With the analytical expressions, the output torque

and current can be obtained dynamically and the geometries of the DSRM

can be further optimized. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)

simulation environment is constructed to perform full system simulation

and the DSRM is shown to be capable of being an auxiliary power source

for hybrid scooters.},

Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques, it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model-based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile, with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.},

 abstract = {Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) is an approach first introduced for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to quantify effective connectivity between brain areas. Recently, this framework has been extended and established in the magneto/encephalography (M/EEG) domain. DCM for M/EEG entails the inversion a full spatiotemporal model of evoked responses, over multiple conditions. This model rests on a biophysical and neurobiological generative model for electrophysiological data. A generative model is a prescription of how data are generated. The inversion of a DCM provides conditional densities on the model parameters and, indeed on the model itself. These densities enable one to answer key questions about the underlying system. A DCM comprises two parts; one part describes the dynamics within and among neuronal sources, and the second describes how source dynamics generate data in the sensors, using the lead-field. The parameters of this spatiotemporal model are estimated using a single (iterative) Bayesian procedure. In this paper, we will motivate and describe the current DCM framework. Two examples show how the approach can be applied to M/EEG experiments.},

 abstract = {Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (paired TMS) was introduced to study local inhibitory or facilitatory intracortical circuits of the primary motor cortex. However, similar interactions can be shown in other areas of cortex. The current study tests the effects of paired pulse TMS of the right primary somatosensory cortex (S1) on the sensory perception of electrical stimuli applied on the contralateral thumb finger. In the main experiment a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (CS) preceded a suprathreshold test stimulus (TS) at different inter-stimulus intervals. We found that perception of a peripheral electrical stimulus was markedly attenuated by paired TMS in comparison to single pulse TMS when the ISIs was 10 or 15 ms, while there was no effect at shorter ISIs. There was no additional effect of the CS pulse if the intensity of the TS was subthreshold. In control experiments we observed that the effect vanished when the delay between the peripheral stimulus and the TS was 10 or 30 ms rather than 20 ms or if the pairs of pulses were applied over the vertex rather than the hand area. Furthermore, there was no change at longer ISIs when paired TMS was applied over the posterior parietal cortex of the same hemisphere. These results demonstrate that paired pulse TMS is able to probe intracortical circuits in S1 and that the intrinsic properties of these circuits differ even between closely adjacent areas of the cortex.},

The present in-vivo conductivity values could serve to create more accurate volume conduction models and could help to refine the identification of relevant intracerebral contacts, especially when located within the epileptogenic zone of an MRI-invisible lesion.

suited for pulsed EC techniques which cover a broader depth range than

standard single frequency EC. An inversion procedure is presented

providing a tomographic-like conductivity image of stacked aluminum

sheets used for superconducting cavities of particle accelerators. The

detection of tantalum inclusions and other impurities which lower the

cavity performance is based on the measurement of local current

@article{Krieg.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Currently, it is difficult to predict precise regions of cortical activation in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Most analytical approaches focus on applied magnetic field strength in the target region as the primary factor, placing activation on the gyral crowns. However, imaging studies support M1 targets being typically located in the sulcal banks.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS

To more thoroughly investigate this inconsistency, we sought to determine whether neocortical surface orientation was a critical determinant of regional activation.

METHODS

MR images were used to construct cortical and scalp surfaces for 18 subjects. The angle (\textgreek{j}) between the cortical surface normal and its nearest scalp normal for {\~{}}50,000 cortical points per subject was used to quantify cortical location (i.e., gyral vs. sulcal). TMS-induced activations of primary motor cortex (M1) were compared to brain activations recorded during a finger-tapping task using concurrent positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging.

RESULTS

Brain activations were primarily sulcal for both the TMS and task activations (P {\textless} 0.001 for both) compared to the overall cortical surface orientation. Also, the location of maximal blood flow in response to either TMS or finger-tapping correlated well using the cortical surface orientation angle or distance to scalp (P {\textless} 0.001 for both) as criteria for comparison between different neocortical activation modalities.

CONCLUSION

This study provides further evidence that a major factor in cortical activation using TMS is the orientation of the cortical surface with respect to the induced electric field. The results show that, despite the gyral crown of the cortex being subjected to a larger magnetic field magnitude, the sulcal bank of M1 had larger cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses during TMS.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) represents a powerful technique to noninvasively modulate cortical neurophysiology in the brain. However, the relationship between the magnetic fields created by TMS coils and neuronal activation in the cortex is still not well-understood, making predictable cortical activation by TMS difficult to achieve. Our goal in this study was to investigate the relationship between induced electric fields and cortical activation measured by blood flow response. Particularly, we sought to discover the E-field characteristics that lead to cortical activation. APPROACH: Subject-specific finite element models (FEMs) of the head and brain were constructed for each of six subjects using magnetic resonance image scans. Positron emission tomography (PET) measured each subject's cortical response to image-guided robotically-positioned TMS to the primary motor cortex. FEM models that employed the given coil position, orientation, and stimulus intensity in experimental applications of TMS were used to calculate the electric field (E-field) vectors within a region of interest for each subject. TMS-induced E-fields were analyzed to better understand what vector components led to regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses recorded by PET. MAIN RESULTS: This study found that decomposing the E-field into orthogonal vector components based on the cortical surface geometry (and hence, cortical neuron directions) led to significant differences between the regions of cortex that were active and nonactive. Specifically, active regions had significantly higher E-field components in the normal inward direction (i.e., parallel to pyramidal neurons in the dendrite-to-axon orientation) and in the tangential direction (i.e., parallel to interneurons) at high gradient. In contrast, nonactive regions had higher E-field vectors in the outward normal direction suggesting inhibitory responses. SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide critical new understanding of the factors by which TMS induces cortical activation necessary for predictive and repeatable use of this noninvasive stimulation modality.},

 abstract = {Responses elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand motor area depend on the position and orientation of the stimulating coil. In this work, we computationally investigate the induced electric field for multiple coil orientations and locations in order to determine which parts of the brain are affected and how the sensitivity of motor cortical activation depends on the direction of the electric field. The finite element method is used for calculating the electric field induced by TMS in two individual anatomical models of the head and brain. The orientation of the coil affects both the strength and depth of penetration of the electric field, and the field strongly depends on the direction of the sulcus, where the target neurons are located. The coil position that gives the strongest electric field in the target cortical region may deviate from the closest scalp location by a distance on the order of 1 cm. Together with previous experimental data, the results support the hypothesis that the cortex is most sensitive to fields oriented perpendicular to the cortical layers, while it is relatively insensitive to fields parallel to them. This has important implications for targeting of TMS. To determine the most effective coil position and orientation, it is essential to consider both biological (the direction of the targeted axons) and physical factors (the strength and direction of the electric field).},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Despite recent developments in navigation and modeling techniques, the type and location of the structures that are activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) remain unknown.

OBJECTIVE

We studied the relationships between electrophysiological measurements and electric fields induced in the brain to locate the TMS activation site.

METHODS

The active and resting motor thresholds of the first dorsal interosseous muscle were recorded in 19 subjects (7 female, 12 male, age 22~$\pm$~4 years) using anteromedially oriented monophasic TMS at multiple locations over the left primary motor cortex (M1). Structural MR images were used to construct electric field models of each subject's head and brain. The cortical activation site was estimated by finding where the calculated electric fields best explained the coil-location dependency of the measured MTs.

RESULTS

The experiments and modeling showed individual variations both in the measured motor thresholds (MTs) and in the computed electric fields. When the TMS coil was moved on the scalp, the calculated electric fields in the hand knob region were shown to vary consistently with the measured MTs. Group-level analysis indicated that the electric fields were significantly correlated with the measured MTs. The strongest correlations (R2~=~0.69), which indicated the most likely activation site, were found in the ventral and lateral part of the hand knob. The site was independent of voluntary contractions of the target muscle.

CONCLUSION

The study showed that TMS combined with personalized electric field modeling can be used for high-resolution mapping of the motor cortex.},

The goal of this study was to examine the in vivo changes in the DBS electrode impedance that occur after implantation and during clinically relevant stimulation. Clinical DBS devices typically apply high-frequency voltage-controlled stimulation, and as a result, the injected current is directly regulated by the impedance of the electrode-tissue interface. We monitored the impedance of scaled-down clinical DBS electrodes implanted in the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus of a rhesus macaque using electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements ranging from 0.5 Hz to 10 kHz. To further characterize our measurements, equivalent circuit models of the electrode-tissue interface were used to quantify the role of various interface components in producing the observed electrode impedance. Following implantation, the DBS electrode impedance increased and a semicircular arc was observed in the high-frequency range of the EIS measurements, commonly referred to as the tissue component of the impedance. Clinically relevant stimulation produced a rapid decrease in electrode impedance with extensive changes in the tissue component. These post-operative and stimulation-induced changes in impedance could play an important role in the observed functional effects of voltage-controlled DBS and should be considered during clinical stimulation parameter selection and chronic animal research studies.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective alternative for pharmacotherapy in treatment-resistant depressive patients, but the side effects limit its use. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been proposed as a refined alternative, but most studies do not indicate that TMS is as effective as ECT for severe depression.

OBJECTIVE

We propose that the limited effectiveness of standard TMS resides in its superficial effect on the cortex, although much of the pathophysiology of depression is associated with deeper and larger brain regions implicated in the reward system. Herein, we tested the effectiveness and safety of a novel TMS coil, the {\dq}H-coil,{\dq} which enables direct stimulation of deeper brain regions, at the expense of focality.

METHODS

We have studied the antidepressant and cognitive effects induced by 4 weeks of high-frequency (20 Hz) repeated deep TMS (DTMS) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 65 medication-free depressive patients, who have failed to benefit from prior medications. Patients were randomly assigned to various treatment configurations, differing in stimulation intensity and laterality. Effects were assessed by the 24-item Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS-24) and several secondary outcome measures.

RESULTS

A significant improvement in HDRS scores was found when high, but not low, stimulation intensity was used. Several cognitive improvements were evident, and no treatment-related serious adverse events were observed.

CONCLUSIONS

DTMS over the PFC was found safe and effective in alleviating depression. The results accentuate the significance of deep, high-intensity stimulation over low, and serve as the first study to indicate the potential of DTMS in psychiatric and neurologic disorders.},

@article{LoConte.1994,
 abstract = {Nonstationary signals with finite time support are frequently encountered in electrophysiology and other fields of biomedical research. It is often desirable to have a compact description of their shape and of their time evolution. For this purpose, Fourier analysis is not necessarily the best tool. The Hermite-Rodriguez and Associated Hermite basis functions are applied in this work. Both are based on the product of Hermite polynomials and Gaussian functions. Their general properties relevant to biomedical signal processing are reviewed. Preliminary applications are described concerning the analysis and description of: a) test signals such as a square pulse and a single cycle of a sinewave, b) electrically evoked myoelectric signals, and c) power spectra of either voluntary or evoked signals. It is shown that expansions with only five to ten terms provide an excellent description of the computer simulated and real signals. It is shown that these two families of Hermite functions are well suited for the analysis of nonstationary biological evoked potentials with compact time support. An application to the estimation of scaling factors of electrically evoked myoelectric signals is described. The Hermite functions show advantages with respect to the more traditional spectral analysis, especially in the case of signal truncation due to stimulation with interpulse intervals smaller than the duration of the evoked response. Finally, the Hermite approach is found to be suitable for classification of spectral shapes and compression of spectral information of either voluntary or evoked signals. The approach is very promising for neuromuscular diagnosis and assessment because of its capability for information compression and waveform classification.},

@article{Logothetis.2007,
 abstract = {To combine insights obtained from electric field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking activity (MUA) we need a better understanding of the relative spatial summation of these indices of neuronal activity. Compared to MUA, the LFP has greater spatial coherence, resulting in lower spatial specificity and lower stimulus selectivity. A differential propagation of low- and high-frequency electric signals supposedly underlies this phenomenon, which could result from cortical tissue specifically attenuating higher frequencies, i.e., from a frequency-dependent impedance spectrum. Here we directly measure the cortical impedance spectrum in vivo in monkey primary visual cortex. Our results show that impedance is independent of frequency, is homogeneous and tangentially isotropic within gray matter, and can be theoretically predicted assuming a pure-resistive conductor. We propose that the spatial summation of LFP and MUA is determined by the size of these signals' generators and the nature of neural events underlying them, rather than by biophysical properties of gray matter.},

@article{Lustig.2007,
 abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

 abstract = {High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus or basal ganglia represents an effective clinical technique for the treatment of several medically refractory movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia). In addition, new clinical applications of DBS for other neurologic and psychiatric disorders (e.g., epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorder) have been vaulted forward. Although DBS has been effective in the treatment of movement disorders and is rapidly being explored for the treatment of other neurologic disorders, the scientific understanding of its mechanisms of action remains unclear and continues to be debated in the scientific community. Optimization of DBS technology for present and future therapeutic applications will depend on identification of the therapeutic mechanism(s) of action. The goal of this review is to address the present knowledge of the effects of high frequency stimulation within the central nervous system and comment on the functional implications of this knowledge for uncovering the mechanism(s) of DBS. Four general hypotheses have been developed to explain the mechanism(s) of DBS: depolarization blockade, synaptic inhibition, synaptic depression, and stimulation-induced modulation of pathologic network activity. Using the results from microdialysis, neural recording, functional imaging, and neural modeling experiments, the authors address the main hypotheses and attempt to reconcile what have been considered conflicting results from different research modalities.},

 abstract = {An experimental technique is presented to measure two-dimensional

magnetic fields outside a cylindrical cell containing two electrically

conducting fluids as the primary step of magnetic field tomography

(MFT). The magnetic field is induced by a direct current through the

fluids. Under a periodic, vertical vibration driven by a pneumatic

shaker, Faraday instabilities are generated, which lead to a series of

non-axisymmetrical wave modes, and the non-axisymmetrical interface

shape introduces a perturbation to the magnetic field which can be

measured by eight two-dimensional fluxgate sensors fixed concentrically

and uniformly around the cell. The original signals from the sensors are

collected by a Keithley data acquisition board and processed by fast

Fourier transform (FFT). The amplitude and frequency of the magnetic

flux density are extracted successfully. Based on the measured magnetic

field distribution, the maximum of the interface displacement is

reconstructed by an evolutionary strategy, which is in good agreement

with the optical measurement. This MFT system can be applied to study

the interface movements in aluminium reduction cells, in iron/steel

making, in glass melts, and in other electromagnetic processing of

materials.},

A model is used to extract electrical model parameters of the electrode-tissue interface, and is used to isolate the impedance of the tissue immediately surrounding the microelectrode. The microelectrode arrays consist of microfabricated polyimide probes, incorporating four 50- mum-diameter platinum microelectrodes. The devices were implanted in the primary motor cortex of adult rats, and measurements were performed for 12 weeks. Histology was performed on implants at three time points in one month. Results demonstrate that the tissue reaction causes a rapid increase in bioimpedance over the first 20 days, and then stabilizes. This result is supported by histological data.},

@article{Merlet.2013,
 abstract = {Both biophysical and neurophysiological aspects need to be considered to assess the impact of electric fields induced by transcranial current stimulation (tCS) on the cerebral cortex and the subsequent effects occurring on scalp EEG. The objective of this work was to elaborate a global model allowing for the simulation of scalp EEG signals under tCS. In our integrated modeling approach, realistic meshes of the head tissues and of the stimulation electrodes were first built to map the generated electric field distribution on the cortical surface. Secondly, source activities at various cortical macro-regions were generated by means of a computational model of neuronal populations. The model parameters were adjusted so that populations generated an oscillating activity around 10 Hz resembling typical EEG alpha activity. In order to account for tCS effects and following current biophysical models, the calculated component of the electric field normal to the cortex was used to locally influence the activity of neuronal populations. Lastly, EEG under both spontaneous and tACS-stimulated (transcranial sinunoidal tCS from 4 to 16 Hz) brain activity was simulated at the level of scalp electrodes by solving the forward problem in the aforementioned realistic head model. Under the 10 Hz-tACS condition, a significant increase in alpha power occurred in simulated scalp EEG signals as compared to the no-stimulation condition. This increase involved most channels bilaterally, was more pronounced on posterior electrodes and was only significant for tACS frequencies from 8 to 12 Hz. The immediate effects of tACS in the model agreed with the post-tACS results previously reported in real subjects. Moreover, additional information was also brought by the model at other electrode positions or stimulation frequency. This suggests that our modeling approach can be used to compare, interpret and predict changes occurring on EEG with respect to parameters used in specific stimulation configurations.},

@article{Michel.2016,
 abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an electrical properties tomography (EPT) technique that can provide in vivo electrical conductivity and permittivity images of biological tissue without performing complex-valued radiofrequency field measurements. THEORY AND METHODS: Electrical conductivity and permittivity images are modeled as a monotonic function of tissues' water content (W) under the principle of Maxwell's mixture theory. Water content maps are estimated from two spin-echo images having different repetition times (TRs). For the modeling functions, physically measured parameters (electrical properties, water content, and T1 ) of brain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter, and white matter are used as landmark literature references. The formulations are validated by a developed electrolyte-protein phantom and by human brain studies at 3 Tesla (T). RESULTS: The electrical properties (EPs) of the phantom estimated by the proposed method match well with the values measured on the bench. The conductivity and permittivity maps from all experiments show uncompromised spatial resolution without boundary artifacts and higher contrast when compared with water content maps. CONCLUSIONS: Human brain and phantom EP images suggest that water content is a dominating factor in determining the electrical properties of tissues. Despite possible literature inaccuracies, the proposed method offers EP maps that can provide complementary information to current approaches, to facilitate EPT scans in clinical applications.

 abstract = {Magnetic non-destructive methods utilising the Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) and Magnetic Barkhausen Noise (MBN) phenomena are widely used in the evaluation of the structural integrity of steel components. The MFL method is effectively applied for in-service flaw monitoring of oil and gas pipelines, fuel storage tank floors and rails; whereas the MBN method, due to high sensitivity of Barkhausen emission to residual and applied stress, has become one of the most popular NDE tools for investigating this condition of steels. Despite the affirming research and successful applications, which helped these methods to gain acceptance as a viable non-destructive tools, there is still a requirement for establishing a quantitative links between magnetic and mechanical properties of steel which would enable their further understanding and optimisation. In this thesis the applications of MFL and MBN methods for flaw and stress detection are analysed via analytical and numerical modelling. A new model relating the MBN amplitude and stress for materials having different magnetostrictive behaviour under load is proposed and validated in the quantitative stress evaluation of different grades of steel. Moreover, a new method for determining depth dependence of stress from measured magnetic Barkhausen signals is presented. A complete set of newly derived equations describing the detected Barkhausen signals in terms of the actual emissions that are generated inside the material and how these appear when they propagate to the surface is given. The results from finite element modelling of magnetic flux leakage signals above unflawed and flawed rails energised in various directions are presented. These results enabled to identify the most effective current injection procedure and optimise the probability of transverse flaw detection in the rail inspection. The agreement between modelled and measured electromagnetic signals indicating presence of transverse rail defects has been justified.},

@article{Mina.2013,
 abstract = {A number of studies showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) can modulate the activity in the epileptic brain and that a decrease of seizures can be achieved in {\dq}responding{\dq} patients. In most of these studies, the choice of stimulation parameters is critical to obtain desired clinical effects. In particular, the stimulation frequency is a key parameter that is difficult to tune. A reason is that our knowledge about the frequency-dependant mechanisms according to which DBS indirectly impacts the dynamics of pathological neuronal systems located in the neocortex is still limited. We address this issue using both computational modeling and intracerebral EEG (iEEG) data. We developed a macroscopic (neural mass) model of the thalamocortical network. In line with already-existing models, it includes interconnected neocortical pyramidal cells and interneurons, thalamocortical cells and reticular neurons. The novelty was to introduce, in the thalamic compartment, the biophysical effects of direct stimulation. Regarding clinical data, we used a quite unique data set recorded in a patient (drug-resistant epilepsy) with a focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). In this patient, DBS strongly reduced the sustained epileptic activity of the FCD for low-frequency (LFS, {\textless} 2 Hz) and high-frequency stimulation (HFS, {\textgreater} 70 Hz) while intermediate-frequency stimulation (IFS, around 50 Hz) had no effect. Signal processing, clustering, and optimization techniques allowed us to identify the necessary conditions for reproducing, in the model, the observed frequency-dependent stimulation effects. Key elements which explain the suppression of epileptic activity in the FCD include: (a) feed-forward inhibition and synaptic short-term depression of thalamocortical connections at LFS, and (b) inhibition of the thalamic output at HFS. Conversely, modeling results indicate that IFS favors thalamic oscillations and entrains epileptic dynamics.},

 abstract = {We investigate the heterogeneity of electrical conductivity as a new mechanism to stimulate excitable tissues via applied electric fields. In particular, we show that stimulation of axons crossing internal boundaries can occur at boundaries where the electric conductivity of the volume conductor changes abruptly. The effectiveness of this and other stimulation mechanisms was compared by means of models and computer simulations in the context of transcranial magnetic stimulation. While, for a given stimulation intensity, the largest membrane depolarization occurred where an axon terminates or bends sharply in a high electric field region, a slightly smaller membrane depolarization, still sufficient to generate action potentials, also occurred at an internal boundary where the conductivity jumped from 0.143 S m(-1) to 0.333 S m(-1), simulating a white-matter-grey-matter interface. Tissue heterogeneity can also give rise to local electric field gradients that are considerably stronger and more focal than those impressed by the stimulation coil and that can affect the membrane potential, albeit to a lesser extent than the two mechanisms mentioned above. Tissue heterogeneity may play an important role in electric and magnetic 'far-field' stimulation.},

@article{Miyawaki.2012,
 abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) noninvasively interferes with human cortical function, and is widely used as an effective technique for probing causal links between neural activity and cognitive function. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying TMS-induced effects on neural activity remain unclear. We examined the mechanism by which TMS disrupts neural activity in a local circuit in early visual cortex using a computational model consisting of conductance-based spiking neurons with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. We found that single-pulse TMS suppressed spiking activity in a local circuit model, disrupting the population response. Spike suppression was observed when TMS was applied to the local circuit within a limited time window after the local circuit received sensory afferent input, as observed in experiments investigating suppression of visual perception with TMS targeting early visual cortex. Quantitative analyses revealed that the magnitude of suppression was significantly larger for synaptically-connected neurons than for isolated individual neurons, suggesting that intracortical inhibitory synaptic coupling also plays an important role in TMS-induced suppression. A conventional local circuit model of early visual cortex explained only the early period of visual suppression observed in experiments. However, models either involving strong recurrent excitatory synaptic connections or sustained excitatory input were able to reproduce the late period of visual suppression. These results suggest that TMS targeting early visual cortex disrupts functionally distinct neural signals, possibly corresponding to feedforward and recurrent information processing, by imposing inhibitory effects through intracortical inhibitory synaptic connections.},

@article{Modolo.2013,
 abstract = {Neural mass models are an appropriate framework to study brain activity, combining a high degree of biological realism while being mathematically tractable. These models have been used, with a certain success, to simulate brain electric (electroencephalography, EEG) and metabolic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) activity. However, concrete applications of neural mass models have remained limited to date. Motivated by experimental results obtained in humans, we propose in this paper a neural mass model designed to study the interaction between power-line magnetic fields (MFs) (60 Hz in North America) and brain activity. The model includes pyramidal cells; dendrite-projecting, slow GABAergic neurons; soma-projecting, fast GABAergic neurons; and glutamatergic interneurons. A simple phenomenological model of interaction between the induced electric field and neuron membranes is also considered, along with a model of post-synaptic calcium concentration and associated changes in synaptic weights Simulated EEG signals are produced in a simple protocol, both in the absence and presence of a 60 Hz MF. These results are discussed based on results obtained previously in humans. Notably, results highlight that (1) EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) power can be modulated by weak membrane depolarizations induced by the exposure; (2) the level of input noise has a significant impact on EEG power modulation; and (3) the threshold value in MF flux density resulting in a significant effect on the EEG depends on the type of neuronal populations modulated by the MF exposure. Results obtained from the model shed new light on the effects of power-line MFs on brain activity, and will provide guidance in future human experiments. This may represent a valuable contribution to international regulation agencies setting guidelines on MF values to which the general public and workers can be exposed.},

@article{Moezzi.2018,
 abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique that enables noninvasive manipulation of neural activity and holds promise in both clinical and basic research settings. The effect of TMS on the motor cortex is often measured by electromyography (EMG) recordings from a small hand muscle. However, the details of how TMS generates responses measured with EMG are not completely understood. We aim to develop a biophysically detailed computational model to study the potential mechanisms underlying the generation of EMG signals following TMS. Our model comprises a feed-forward network of cortical layer 2/3 cells, which drive morphologically detailed layer 5 corticomotoneuronal cells, which in turn project to a pool of motoneurons. EMG signals are modeled as the sum of motor unit action potentials. EMG recordings from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle were performed in four subjects and compared to simulated EMG signals. Our model successfully reproduces several characteristics of the experimental data. The simulated EMG signals match experimental EMG recordings in shape and size, and change with stimulus intensity and contraction level as in experimental recordings. They exhibit cortical silent periods that are close to the biological values, and reveal an interesting dependence on inhibitory synaptic transmission properties. Our model predicts several characteristics of the firing patterns of neurons along the entire pathway from cortical layer 2/3 cells down to spinal motoneurons and should be considered as a viable tool for explaining and analyzing EMG signals following TMS.},

 abstract = {Although it is well-admitted that transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) allows for interacting with brain endogenous rhythms, the exact mechanisms by which externally-applied fields modulate the activity of neurons remain elusive. In this study a novel computational model (a neural mass model including subpopulations of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons mediating synaptic currents with either slow or fast kinetics) of the cerebral cortex was elaborated to investigate the local effects of tDCS on neuronal populations based on an in-vivo experimental study. Model parameters were adjusted to reproduce evoked potentials (EPs) recorded from the somatosensory cortex of the rabbit in response to air-puffs applied on the whiskers. EPs were simulated under control condition (no tDCS) as well as under anodal and cathodal tDCS fields. Results first revealed that a feed-forward inhibition mechanism must be included in the model for accurate simulation of actual EPs (peaks and latencies). Interestingly, results revealed that externally-applied fields are also likely to affect interneurons. Indeed, when interneurons get polarized then the characteristics of simulated EPs become closer to those of real EPs. In particular, under anodal tDCS condition, more realistic EPs could be obtained when pyramidal cells were depolarized and, simultaneously, slow (resp. fast) interneurons became de- (resp. hyper-) polarized. Geometrical characteristics of interneurons might provide some explanations for this effect.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between the peak temperature elevation and the peak specific absorption rate (SAR) averaged over 10 g of tissue in human head models in the frequency range of 1-30 GHz. As a wave source, a half-wave dipole antenna resonant at the respective frequencies is located in the proximity of the pinna. The bioheat equation is used to evaluate the temperature elevation by employing the SAR, which is computed by electromagnetic analysis, as a heat source. The computed SAR is post-processed by calculating the peak spatial-averaged SAR with six averaging algorithms that consider different descriptions provided in international guidelines and standards, e.g. the number of tissues allowed in the averaging volume, different averaging shapes, and the consideration of the pinna. The computational results show that the SAR averaging algorithms excluding the pinna are essential when correlating the peak temperature elevation in the head excluding the pinna. In the averaging scheme considering an arbitrary shape, for better correlation, multiple tissues should be included in the averaging volume rather than a single tissue. For frequencies higher than 3-4 GHz, the correlation for peak temperature elevation in the head excluding the pinna is modest for the different algorithms. The 95th percentile value of the heating factor as well as the mean and median values derived here would be helpful for estimating the possible temperature elevation in the head.},

 abstract = {Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.},

 abstract = {An array of biomagnetometers may be used to measure the spatio-temporal neuromagnetic field or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) produced by neural activity in the brain. A popular model for the neural activity produced in response to a given sensory stimulus is a set of current dipoles, where each dipole represents the primary current associated with the combined activation of a large number of neurons located in a small volume of the brain. An important problem in the interpretation of MEG data from evoked response experiments is the localization of these neural current dipoles. We present here a linear algebraic framework for three common spatio-temporal dipole models: i) unconstrained dipoles, ii) dipoles with a fixed location, and iii) dipoles with a fixed orientation and location. In all cases, we assume that the location, orientation, and magnitude of the dipoles are unknown. With a common model, we show how the parameter estimation problem may be decomposed into the estimation of the time invariant parameters using nonlinear least-squares minimization, followed by linear estimation of the associated time varying parameters. A subspace formulation is presented and used to derive a suboptimal least-squares subspace scanning method. The resulting algorithm is a special case of the well-known MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) method, in which the solution (multiple dipole locations) is found by scanning potential locations using a simple one dipole model. Principal components analysis (PCA) dipole fitting has also been used to individually fit single dipoles in a multiple dipole problem. Analysis is presented here to show why PCA dipole fitting will fail in general, whereas the subspace method presented here will generally succeed. Numerically efficient means of calculating the cost functions are presented, and problems of model order selection and missing moments are discussed. Results from a simulation and a somatosensory experiment are presented.},

Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are promising sensors for applications in

eddy current nondestructive evaluation (NDE). Due to their high field

sensitivity at low frequencies, they are especially suitable for

applications, where a large penetration depth is required. We have

investigated two different SQUID-based NDE systems, one of which is

optimised for testing felloes of aircraft wheels. The second system

allows for testing planar structures using a motorised x-y-stage, which

moves the cryostat above the planar samples. As sensors 3 GHz rf SQUIDs

made from YBCO were used, having a field noise of about 1 pT/root Hz.

This results in a dynamic range of our SQUID system of about 155 dB/root

Hz. In most cases, the SQUIDs have been cooled by immersing them in

liquid nitrogen. We have however also developed a cryosystem, which

allows for cooling the sensors by a Ne-gas flow. In planar test

structures we could detect flaws with lengths of 10 mm, having a height

of 0.6 mm in a depth of 13 mm. In aircraft felloes, flaws located at the

inner surface of the felloe (thickness 8 mm) were easily detectable

despite a high static background field of up to 0.5 G caused by

ferromagnetic structures inside the felloe. For flaws in a depth of 5

mm, the spatial resolution of both systems was about 8 mm without

applying image postprocessing.},

 abstract = {{\dq}The book covers the most common and important approaches for the identification of nonlinear static and dynamic systems. Additionally, it provides the reader with the necessary background on optimization techniques making the book self-contained. The emphasis is put on modern methods based on neural networks and fuzzy systems without neglecting the classical approaches. The entire book is written from an engineering point-of-view, focusing on the intuitive understanding of the basic relationships. This is supported by many illustrative figures. Advanced mathematics is avoided. Thus, the book is suitable for last year undergraduate and graduate courses as well as research and development engineers in industries.{\dq}--Jacket.},

 abstract = {In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), knowledge of the distribution of the induced electric field is fundamental for a better understanding of the position and extent of the stimulated brain region. However, the different tissue types and the varying fibre orientation in the brain tissue result in an inhomogeneous and anisotropic conductivity distribution and distort the electric field in a non-trivial way. Here, the field induced by a figure-8 coil is characterized in detail using finite element calculations and a geometrically accurate model of an individual head combined with high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging for conductivity mapping. It is demonstrated that the field strength is significantly enhanced when the currents run approximately perpendicular to the local gyral orientation. Importantly, the spatial distribution of this effect differs distinctly between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM): While the field in GM is selectively enhanced at the gyral crowns and lips, high field strengths can still occur rather deep in WM. Taking the anisotropy of brain tissue into account tends to further boost this effect in WM, but not in GM. Spatial variations in the WM anisotropy affect the local field strength in a systematic way and result in localized increases of up to 40{\%} (on average {\~{}}7{\%} for coil orientations perpendicular to the underlying gyri). We suggest that these effects might create hot spots in WM that might contribute to the excitation of WM structures by TMS. However, our results also demonstrate the necessity of using realistic nerve models in the future to allow for more definitive conclusions.},

 abstract = {Recent evidence indicates subject-specific gyral folding patterns and white matter anisotropy uniquely shape electric fields generated by TMS. Current methods for predicting the brain regions influenced by TMS involve projecting the TMS coil position or center of gravity onto realistic head models derived from structural and functional imaging data. Similarly, spherical models have been used to estimate electric field distributions generated by TMS pulses delivered from a particular coil location and position. In the present paper we inspect differences between electric field computations estimated using the finite element method (FEM) and projection-based approaches described above. We then more specifically examined an approach for estimating cortical excitation volumes based on individualistic FEM simulations of electric fields. We evaluated this approach by performing neurophysiological recordings during MR-navigated motormapping experiments. We recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to single pulse TMS using two different coil orientations (45 degrees and 90 degrees to midline) at 25 different locations (5x5 grid, 1cm spacing) centered on the hotspot of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in left motor cortex. We observed that motor excitability maps varied within and between subjects as a function of TMS coil position and orientation. For each coil position and orientation tested, simulations of the TMS-induced electric field were computed using individualistic FEM models and compared to MEP amplitudes obtained during our motormapping experiments. We found FEM simulations of electric field strength, which take into account subject-specific gyral geometry and tissue conductivity anisotropy, significantly correlated with physiologically observed MEP amplitudes (rmax=0.91, p=1.8x10(-5) rmean=0.81, p=0.01). These observations validate the implementation of individualistic FEM models to account for variations in gyral folding patterns and tissue conductivity anisotropy, which should help improve the targeting accuracy of TMS in the mapping or modulation of human brain circuits.},

@article{Opitz.2015,
 abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) causes a complex spatial distribution of the electric current flow in the head which hampers the accurate localization of the stimulated brain areas. In this study we show how various anatomical features systematically shape the electric field distribution in the brain during tDCS. We constructed anatomically realistic finite element (FEM) models of two individual heads including conductivity anisotropy and different skull layers. We simulated a widely employed electrode montage to induce motor cortex plasticity and moved the stimulating electrode over the motor cortex in small steps to examine the resulting changes of the electric field distribution in the underlying cortex. We examined the effect of skull thickness and composition on the passing currents showing that thinner skull regions lead to higher electric field strengths. This effect is counteracted by a larger proportion of higher conducting spongy bone in thicker regions leading to a more homogenous current over the skull. Using a multiple regression model we could identify key factors that determine the field distribution to a significant extent, namely the thicknesses of the cerebrospinal fluid and the skull, the gyral depth and the distance to the anode and cathode. These factors account for up to 50{\%} of the spatial variation of the electric field strength. Further, we demonstrate that individual anatomical factors can lead to stimulation {\dq}hotspots{\dq} which are partly resistant to electrode positioning. Our results give valuable novel insights in the biophysical foundation of tDCS and highlight the importance to account for individual anatomical factors when choosing an electrode montage.},

 abstract = {Eddy current non-destructive evaluation (NDE) often uses excitation currents at a fixed frequency, which determines the depth of investigation due to the skin effect. We developed a novel pulsed eddy current NDE technique which potentially may cover a broader depth range, by analyzing the decay of the recorded transient. Eddy currents in the inspected aluminium structures were induced by turn-off of the primary magnetic field pulse in a transmitter coil. The secondary magnetic field created by the induced currents was recorded by an HTS superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. The quickly decaying early time data of the transient signal corresponds to the information from upper layers of the plate, while the late time data delivers information from deep layers. In order to suppress environmental noise and increase the signal-to-noise ratio, repetitive square-wave pulses were used. The transient response of the plate was recorded in off-time between the transmitter pulses and averaged using a commercial LAPTEM data acquisition unit. Measurements of a crack at different depths in a stacked aluminium sample are presented. The data was analyzed by calculating the apparent conductivity of the sample as a function of depth, a technique often used in Geophysical data interpretation. Possible advantages and drawbacks of this new transient NDE technique are discussed.},

@article{Pashut.2011,
 abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a stimulation method in which a magnetic coil generates a magnetic field in an area of interest in the brain. This magnetic field induces an electric field that modulates neuronal activity. The spatial distribution of the induced electric field is determined by the geometry and location of the coil relative to the brain. Although TMS has been used for several decades, the biophysical basis underlying the stimulation of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) is still unknown. To address this problem we developed a numerical scheme enabling us to combine realistic magnetic stimulation (MS) with compartmental modeling of neurons with arbitrary morphology. The induced electric field for each location in space was combined with standard compartmental modeling software to calculate the membrane current generated by the electromagnetic field for each segment of the neuron. In agreement with previous studies, the simulations suggested that peripheral axons were excited by the spatial gradients of the induced electric field. In both peripheral and central neurons, MS amplitude required for action potential generation was inversely proportional to the square of the diameter of the stimulated compartment. Due to the importance of the fiber's diameter, magnetic stimulation of CNS neurons depolarized the soma followed by initiation of an action potential in the initial segment of the axon. Passive dendrites affect this process primarily as current sinks, not sources. The simulations predict that neurons with low current threshold are more susceptible to magnetic stimulation. Moreover, they suggest that MS does not directly trigger dendritic regenerative mechanisms. These insights into the mechanism of MS may be relevant for the design of multi-intensity TMS protocols, may facilitate the construction of magnetic stimulators, and may aid the interpretation of results of TMS of the CNS.},

@article{Penny.2004,
 abstract = {This article describes the use of Bayes factors for comparing dynamic causal models (DCMs). DCMs are used to make inferences about effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These inferences, however, are contingent upon assumptions about model structure, that is, the connectivity pattern between the regions included in the model. Given the current lack of detailed knowledge on anatomical connectivity in the human brain, there are often considerable degrees of freedom when defining the connectional structure of DCMs. In addition, many plausible scientific hypotheses may exist about which connections are changed by experimental manipulation, and a formal procedure for directly comparing these competing hypotheses is highly desirable. In this article, we show how Bayes factors can be used to guide choices about model structure, both concerning the intrinsic connectivity pattern and the contextual modulation of individual connections. The combined use of Bayes factors and DCM thus allows one to evaluate competing scientific theories about the architecture of large-scale neural networks and the neuronal interactions that mediate perception and cognition.},

Its use is less mature in geotechnical design, but there is a steady progression towards reliability-based design as seen in the inclusion of a new Annex D on {\dq}{\dq}Reliability of Geotechnical Structures{\dq}{\dq} in the third edition of ISO 2394. Reliability-based design can be viewed as a simplified form of risk-based design where different consequences of failure are implicitly covered by the adoption of different target reliability indices. Explicit risk management methodologies are required for large geotechnical systems where soil and loading conditions are too varied to be conveniently slotted into a few reliability classes (typically three) and an associated simple discrete tier of target reliability indices.},

 abstract = {Image distortion due to field gradient eddy currents can create image artifacts in diffusion-weighted MR images. These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less distortion and consequently improves image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion anisotropy images of normal human brain.},

 abstract = {We study the impact of coil orientation on the motor threshold (MT) and present an optimal coil orientation for stimulation of the foot. The result can be compared to results of models that predict this orientation from electrodynamic properties of the media in the skull and from orientations of cells, respectively. We used a robotized TMS system for precise coil placement and recorded motor-evoked potentials with surface electrodes on the abductor hallucis muscle of the right foot in 8 healthy control subjects. First, we performed a hot-spot search in standard (lateral) orientation and then rotated the coil in steps of 10 degrees or 20 degrees . At each step we estimated the MT. For navigated stimulation and for correlation with the underlying anatomy a structural MRI scan was obtained. Optimal coil orientation was 33.1 +/- 18.3 degrees anteriorly in relation to the standard lateral orientation. In this orientation the threshold was 54 +/- 18{\%} in units of maximum stimulator output. There was a significant difference of 8.0 +/- 5.9{\%} between the MTs at optimal and at standard orientation. The optimal coil orientations were significantly correlated with the direction perpendicular to the postcentral gyrus ([Formula: see text]). Robotized TMS facilitates sufficiently precise coil positioning and orientation to study even small variations of the MT with coil orientation. The deviations from standard orientation are more closely matched by models based on field propagation in media than by models based on orientations of pyramidal cells.},

@article{Richter.2013b,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is based on a changing magnetic field inducing an electric field in the brain. Conventionally, the TMS coil is mounted to a static holder and the subject is asked to avoid head motion. Additionally, head resting frames have been used. In contrast, our robotized TMS system employs active motion compensation (MC) to maintain the correct coil position.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS

We study the effect of patient motion on TMS. In particular, we compare different coil positioning techniques with respect to the induced electric field.

METHODS

We recorded head motion for six subjects in three scenarios: (a) avoiding head motion, (b) using a head rest, and (c) moving the head freely. Subsequently, the motion traces were replayed using a second robot to move a sensor to measure the electric field in the target region. These head movements were combined with 2 types of coil positioning: (1) using a coil holder and (2) using robotized TMS with MC.

RESULTS

After 30 min the induced electric field was reduced by 32.0{\%} and 19.7{\%} for scenarios (1a) and (1b), respectively. For scenarios (2a)-(2c) it was reduced by only 4.9{\%}, 1.4{\%} and 2.0{\%}, respectively, which is a significant improvement (P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, the orientation of the induced field changed by 5.5°, 7.6°, 0.4°, 0.2°, 0.2° for scenarios (1a)-(2c).

CONCLUSION

While none of the scenarios required rigid head fixation, using a simple holder to position a coil during TMS can lead to substantial deviations in the induced electric field. In contrast, robotic motion compensation results in clinically acceptable positioning throughout treatment.},

@article{Rusu.2014,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows to manipulate neural activity non-invasively, and much research is trying to exploit this ability in clinical and basic research settings. In a standard TMS paradigm, single-pulse stimulation over motor cortex produces repetitive responses in descending motor pathways called I-waves. However, the details of how TMS induces neural activity patterns in cortical circuits to produce these responses remain poorly understood. According to a traditional view, I-waves are due to repetitive synaptic inputs to pyramidal neurons in layer 5 (L5) of motor cortex, but the potential origin of such repetitive inputs is unclear. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Here we aim to test the plausibility of an alternative mechanism behind D- and I-wave generation through computational modeling. This mechanism relies on the broad distribution of conduction delays of synaptic inputs arriving at different parts of L5 cells' dendritic trees and their spike generation mechanism. METHODS: Our model consists of a detailed L5 pyramidal cell and a population of layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) neurons projecting onto it with synapses exhibiting short-term depression. I-waves are simulated as superpositions of spike trains from a large population of L5 cells. RESULTS: Our model successfully reproduces all basic characteristics of I-waves observed in epidural responses during in vivo recordings of conscious humans. In addition, it shows how the complex morphology of L5 neurons might play an important role in the generation of I-waves. In the model, later I-waves are formed due to inputs to distal synapses, while earlier ones are driven by synapses closer to the soma. Finally, the model offers an explanation for the inhibition and facilitation effects in paired-pulse stimulation protocols. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous models, which required either neural oscillators or chains of inhibitory interneurons acting upon L5 cells, our model is fully feed-forward without lateral connections or loops. It parsimoniously explains findings from a range of experiments and should be considered as a viable alternative explanation of the generating mechanism of I-waves.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Low-frequency conductivity and current density imaging using MRI includes magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT), diffusion tensor MREIT (DT-MREIT), conductivity tensor imaging (CTI), and magnetic resonance current density imaging (MRCDI). MRCDI and MREIT provide current density and isotropic conductivity images, respectively, using current-injection phase MRI techniques. DT-MREIT produces anisotropic conductivity tensor images by incorporating diffusion weighted MRI into MREIT. These current-injection techniques are finding clinical applications in diagnostic imaging and also in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and electroporation where treatment currents can function as imaging currents. To avoid adverse effects of nerve and muscle stimulations due to injected currents, conductivity tensor imaging (CTI) utilizes B1 mapping and multi-b diffusion weighted MRI to produce low-frequency anisotropic conductivity tensor images without injecting current. This paper describes numerical implementations of several key mathematical functions for conductivity and current density image reconstructions in MRCDI, MREIT, DT-MREIT, and CTI.

METHODS

To facilitate experimental studies of clinical applications, we developed a software toolbox for these low-frequency conductivity and current density imaging methods. This MR-based conductivity imaging (MRCI) toolbox includes 11 toolbox functions which can be used in the MATLAB environment.

RESULTS

The MRCI toolbox is available at http://iirc.khu.ac.kr/software.html . Its functions were tested by using several experimental datasets, which are provided together with the toolbox.

CONCLUSION

Users of the toolbox can focus on experimental designs and interpretations of reconstructed images instead of developing their own image reconstruction softwares. We expect more toolbox functions to be added from future research outcomes.

@article{Sakai.1997,
 abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the human primary motor cortex (MI) evokes motor responses in the contralateral limb muscles. The latencies and amplitudes of those responses depend on the direction of induced current in the brain by the stimuli (Mills et al. 1992, Werhahn et al. 1994). This observation suggests that different neural elements might be activated by the differently directed induced currents. Using a figure-of-eight-shaped coil, which induces current with a certain direction, we analyzed the effect of direction of stimulating current on the latencies of responses to TMS in normal subjects. The latencies were measured from surface electromyographic responses of the first dorsal interosseous muscles and the peaks in the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of single motor units from the same muscles. The coil was placed over the MI, with eight different directions each separated by 45 degrees. Stimulus intensity was adjusted just above the motor threshold while subjects made a weak tonic voluntary contraction, so that we can analyse the most readily elicited descending volley in the pyramidal tracts. In most subjects, TMS with medially and anteriorly directed current in the brain produced responses or a peak that occurred some 1.5 ms later than those to anodal electrical stimulation. In contrast, TMS with laterally and posteriorly directed current produced responses or a peak that occurred about 4.5 ms later. There was a single peak in most of PSTHs under the above stimulation condition, whereas there were occasionally two peaks under the transitional current directions between the above two groups. These results suggest that TMS with medially and anteriorly directed current in the brain readily elicits I1 waves, whereas that with laterally and posteriorly directed current preferentially elicits I3 waves. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies indicated that this direction was related to the course of the central sulcus. TMS with induced current flowing forward relative to the central sulcus preferentially elicited I1 waves and that flowing backward elicited I3 waves. Our finding of the dependence of preferentially activated I waves on the current direction in the brain suggests that different sets of cortical neurons are responsible for different I waves, and are contrarily oriented. The present method using a figure-of-eight-shaped coil must enable us to study physiological characteristics of each I wave separately and, possibly, analyse different neural elements in MI, since it activates a certain I wave selectively without D waves or other I waves.},

However the underlying mechanisms of TMS-induced alterations in brain function are not well understood. As a result, treatment design parameters are determined ad hoc and not informed by any coherent theory or model. Once the mechanisms underlying TMS's modulatory effects on brain systems are better understood and modeled, TMS's potential as a therapeutic and/or investigative tool will be more readily explored and exploited. An animal model is better suited to study different TMS variables, therefore we developed a baboon model to facilitate testing of some of the current theoretical models of TMS interactions with brain regions. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by successfully imaging cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes with H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography imaging during high-frequency, suprathreshold repetitive TMS in the primary motor cortex of five healthy, adult baboons.},

@article{Schaworonkow.2018,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are notoriously variable. Previous studies have observed a dependence of TMS-induced responses on ongoing brain activity, for instance sensorimotor rhythms. This suggests an opportunity for the development of more effective stimulation protocols through closed-loop TMS-EEG. However, it is not yet clear how features of ongoing activity affect the responses of cortical circuits to TMS.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS

Here we investigate the dependence of TMS-responses on power and phase of ongoing oscillatory activity in a computational model of TMS-induced I-waves.

METHODS

The model comprises populations of cortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons and a population of cortical layer 5 (L5) neurons and generates I-waves in response to TMS. Oscillatory input to the L2/3 neurons induces rhythmic fluctuations in activity of L5 neurons. TMS pulses are simulated at different phases and amplitudes of the ongoing rhythm.

RESULTS

The model shows a robust dependence of I-wave properties on phase and power of ongoing rhythms, with the strongest response occurring for TMS at maximal L5 depolarization. The amount of phase-modulation depends on stimulation intensity, with stronger modulation for lower intensity.

CONCLUSION

The model predicts that responses to TMS are highly variable for low stimulation intensities if ongoing brain rhythms are not taken into account. Closed-loop TMS-EEG holds promise for obtaining more reliable TMS effects.},

For these measurements a static calibration is sufficient. In dynamic measurements however, the measurement deviation caused by using static calibration coefficients increases when approaching the resonance frequency of the sensor. This paper deals with the dynamic characterization of a multi-component force sensor used in Lorentz force eddy current testing, a measurement principle that is based on the measurement of dynamic force reactions. For the dynamic calibration a system is presented that allows the use of various test signals to determine the system parameters of the force transducer. Measurement results for different test signals are shown and main sources of error are discussed. Based on the estimated parameters, an inverse filter [1] can be designed to calculate the dynamic force from the measured output voltages of the sensor.},

When the measurands are getting closer to the sensors resonance frequency, the usage of static calibration factors leads to deviations in the measurement. A dynamic calibration can be used to identify the frequency responses of the sensor and is the basis for designing an appropriate filter that compensates these deviations.

To quantify the uncertainties of the desired quantities without changing the deterministic model, a nonintrusive projection method was used by approximating these quantities by a polynomial expansion on a multidimensional basis known as polynomial chaos. The coefficients of this expansion were computed with a multidimensional quadrature on sparse Smolyak grids. The deterministic model combines a finite element model based on a digital brain atlas and a multicompartmental model of mammalian nerve fibers. The material properties of brain tissue were modeled as uniform random parameters using data from several experimental studies. Different magnitudes of uncertainty in the material properties were computed to allow predictions on the resulting uncertainties in the desired quantities. The results showed a major contribution of the uncertainties in the electrical conductivity values of brain tissue on the voltage response as well as on the predicted VTA, while the influence of the uncertainties in the relative permittivity was negligible.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique to modify neural excitability. Using multi-array tDCS, we investigate the influence of inter-individually varying head tissue conductivity profiles on optimal electrode configurations for an auditory cortex stimulation.

APPROACH

In order to quantify the uncertainty of the optimal electrode configurations, multi-variate generalized polynomial chaos expansions of the model solutions are used based on uncertain conductivity profiles of the compartments skin, skull, gray matter, and white matter. Stochastic measures, probability density functions, and sensitivity of the quantities of interest are investigated for each electrode and the current density at the target with the resulting stimulation protocols visualized on the head surface.

MAIN RESULTS

We demonstrate that the optimized stimulation protocols are only comprised of a few active electrodes, with tolerable deviations in the stimulation amplitude of the anode. However, large deviations in the order of the uncertainty in the conductivity profiles could be noted in the stimulation protocol of the compensating cathodes. Regarding these main stimulation electrodes, the stimulation protocol was most sensitive to uncertainty in skull conductivity. Finally, the probability that the current density amplitude in the auditory cortex target region is supra-threshold was below 50{\%}.

SIGNIFICANCE

The results suggest that an uncertain conductivity profile in computational models of tDCS can have a substantial influence on the prediction of optimal stimulation protocols for stimulation of the auditory cortex. The investigations carried out in this study present a possibility to predict the probability of providing a therapeutic effect with an optimized electrode system for future auditory clinical and experimental procedures of tDCS applications.},

 abstract = {The tomographic imaging of tissue's electrical properties (e.g., conductivity and permittivity) has been greatly improved by recent developments in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques, which include MR electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) and electrical property tomography. When the biological material is subjected to an external electric field, local changes in its electrical properties become sources of magnetic field perturbations, which are detectable by the MR signals. Controlling the external excitation and measuring the responses using an MRI scanner, we can formulate the imaging problem as an inverse problem in which unknown tissue properties are recovered from the acquired MR signals. This inverse problem is nonlinear; it involves the incorporation of Maxwell's equations and Bloch equations during data acquisition. Each method for visualizing internal conductivity and permittivity distributions has its own methodological limitations, and is restricted to imaging only a part of the ensemble or mean tissue structures or states. Therefore, imaging methods can be improved by developing complementary methods that can employ the beneficial aspects of various existing techniques. This paper focuses on recent progress in MREIT and discusses its distinct features in comparison with other imaging methods.},

@article{Shahid.2014,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Computational methods are increasingly used to optimize transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) dose strategies and yet complexities of existing approaches limit their clinical access. Since predictive modelling indicates the relevance of subject/pathology based data and hence the need for subject specific modelling, the incremental clinical value of increasingly complex modelling methods must be balanced against the computational and clinical time and costs. For example, the incorporation of multiple tissue layers and measured diffusion tensor (DTI) based conductivity estimates increase model precision but at the cost of clinical and computational resources. Costs related to such complexities aggregate when considering individual optimization and the myriad of potential montages. Here, rather than considering if additional details change current-flow prediction, we consider when added complexities influence clinical decisions. APPROACH: Towards developing quantitative and qualitative metrics of value/cost associated with computational model complexity, we considered field distributions generated by two 4 x 1 high-definition montages (m1 = 4 x 1 HD montage with anode at C3 and m2 = 4 x 1 HD montage with anode at C1) and a single conventional (m3 = C3-Fp2) tDCS electrode montage. We evaluated statistical methods, including residual error (RE) and relative difference measure (RDM), to consider the clinical impact and utility of increased complexities, namely the influence of skull, muscle and brain anisotropic conductivities in a volume conductor model. MAIN RESULTS: Anisotropy modulated current-flow in a montage and region dependent manner. However, significant statistical changes, produced within montage by anisotropy, did not change qualitative peak and topographic comparisons across montages. Thus for the examples analysed, clinical decision on which dose to select would not be altered by the omission of anisotropic brain conductivity. SIGNIFICANCE: Results illustrate the need to rationally balance the role of model complexity, such as anisotropy in detailed current flow analysis versus value in clinical dose design. However, when extending our analysis to include axonal polarization, the results provide presumably clinically meaningful information. Hence the importance of model complexity may be more relevant with cellular level predictions of neuromodulation.},

The aim of this work is to bridge this gap by investigating the relationship between magnetic fields and defects using both modelling and experimental study and to link these results to quantitative NDE. In this work, 3D FEM numerical simulations are used to predict the response of an eddy current probe being scanned over the area of a defect and understand the underlying change in magnetic field due to the presence of the defect. Experimental investigations are performed to study the feasibility of the proposed magnetic field measurement techniques for defect detection. This experimental work investigates the inspection of both surface and subsurface defects, the use of rectangular (directional) probes and the measurement of complex magnetic field values, as the response in these cases has been found to have a greater correlation with the shape of the defect being studied. As well as the detection of defects, both frequency spectrum and transient information from pulsed eddy current responses are used to reconstruct the profile (depth and width) of a slot shaped defect. The work concludes that the use of magnetic field measurements provides useful information for defect detection and quantification. This will have applications in both industrial and research areas, including visualisation of defects from magnetic field measurements, which can be applied to the monitoring of safety critical components.},

@article{Sparing.2008,
 abstract = {The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with functional neuroimaging has expanded the potential of TMS for human brain mapping. The precise and reliable positioning of the TMS coil is not a simple task, however. Modern frameless stereotaxic systems allow investigators to base navigation either on the subject's structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI data, or the use of functional neuroimaging data from the literature, so-called {\dq}probabilistic approach.{\dq} The latter assumes consistency across individuals in the location of task-related {\dq}activations{\dq} in standardized stereotaxic space. Conventional nonstereotaxic localization of brain areas is also a common method for defining the coil position. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of five different localization strategies in one single study. The left primary motor cortex (left M1-Hand) was used as target region. Three approaches were based on real-time frameless stereotaxy using information based on either anatomical or functional MRI. The remaining two strategies relied either on standard cranial landmarks (i.e., the International 10-20 EEG system) or a standardized function-guided procedure (i.e., the spatial relationship between the left and right M1-Hand). The results were compared to a TMS-based mapping of the primary motor cortex; center of gravity of motor-evoked potentials (MEP-CoG) was calculated for each subject (n = 10). Our findings suggest that highest precision can be achieved with fMRI-guided stimulation, which was accurate within the range of millimeters. Very consistent results were also obtained with the {\dq}probabilistic{\dq} approach. In view of these findings, we discuss the methods and special characteristics of each localization strategy.},

 abstract = {Neural mass models (NMMs) explain dynamics of neuronal populations and were designed to strike a balance between mathematical simplicity and biological plausibility. They are currently widely used as generative models for noninvasive electrophysiological brain measurements; that is, magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here, we systematically describe the oscillatory regimes which a NMM of a single cortical source with extrinsic input from other cortical and subcortical areas to each subpopulation can explain. For this purpose, we used bifurcation analysis to describe qualitative changes in system behavior in response to quantitative input changes. This approach allowed us to describe sequences of oscillatory regimes, given some specific input trajectory. We systematically classified these sequential phenomena and mapped them into parameter space. Our analysis suggests a principled scheme of how complex M/EEG phenomena can be modeled parsimoniously on two time scales: While the system displays fast oscillations, it slowly traverses phase space to another qualitatively different oscillatory regime, depending on the input dynamics. The resulting scheme is useful for applications where one needs to model an ordered sequence of switching between qualitatively different oscillatory regimes, for example, in pharmacological interventions, epilepsy, sleep, or context-induced state changes.},

@article{Spiegler.2011,
 abstract = {Stimulation with rhythmic light flicker (photic driving) plays an important role in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, mood disorder, migraine, and epilepsy. In particular, the adjustment of spontaneous brain rhythms to the stimulus frequency (entrainment) is used to assess the functional flexibility of the brain. We aim to gain deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying this technique and to predict the effects of stimulus frequency and intensity. For this purpose, a modified Jansen and Rit neural mass model (NMM) of a cortical circuit is used. This mean field model has been designed to strike a balance between mathematical simplicity and biological plausibility. We reproduced the entrainment phenomenon observed in EEG during a photic driving experiment. More generally, we demonstrate that such a single area model can already yield very complex dynamics, including chaos, for biologically plausible parameter ranges. We chart the entire parameter space by means of characteristic Lyapunov spectra and Kaplan-Yorke dimension as well as time series and power spectra. Rhythmic and chaotic brain states were found virtually next to each other, such that small parameter changes can give rise to switching from one to another. Strikingly, this characteristic pattern of unpredictability generated by the model was matched to the experimental data with reasonable accuracy. These findings confirm that the NMM is a useful model of brain dynamics during photic driving. In this context, it can be used to study the mechanisms of, for example, perception and epileptic seizure generation. In particular, it enabled us to make predictions regarding the stimulus amplitude in further experiments for improving the entrainment effect.},

According to different structures of the skull samples, all the 388 samples were classified into six categories and measured their resistivities: standard trilayer skull (7943 +/- 1752 ohm x cm, 58 samples), quasi-trilayer skull (14,471 +/- 3061 ohm x cm, 110 samples), standard compact skull (26,546 +/- 5374 ohm x cm, 62 samples), quasi-compact skull (19,824 +/- 3232 ohm x cm, 53 samples), dentate suture skull (5782 +/- 1778 ohm x cm, 41 samples), and squamous suture skull (12747 +/- 4120 ohm x cm, 64 samples). The results showed that the skull resistivities were not homogenous and were significantly influenced by local structural variations. The presence of sutures appeared to decrease the overall resistivity of particular regions largely and dentate suture decreased the resistivity more than squamous suture. The absence of diploe appeared to increase skull resistivity. The percentage on thickness of diploe would be the primary factor in determining the resistivity of the skull sample without suture. From resistivity spectra results, an inverse relationship between skull resistivity and signal frequency was found.},

@article{Thielscher.2002,
 abstract = {A fundamental problem of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is determining the site and size of the stimulated cortical area. In the motor system, the most common procedure for this is motor mapping. The obtained two-dimensional distribution of coil positions with associated muscle responses is used to calculate a center of gravity on the skull. However, even in motor mapping the exact stimulation site on the cortex is not known and only rough estimates of its size are possible. We report a new method which combines physiological measurements with a physical model used to predict the electric field induced by the TMS coil. In four subjects motor responses in a small hand muscle were mapped with 9-13 stimulation sites at the head perpendicular to the central sulcus in order to keep the induced current direction constant in a given cortical region of interest. Input-output functions from these head locations were used to determine stimulator intensities that elicit half-maximal muscle responses. Based on these stimulator intensities the field distribution on the individual cortical surface was calculated as rendered from anatomical MR data. The region on the cortical surface in which the different stimulation sites produced the same electric field strength (minimal variance, 4.2 +/- 0.8{\%}.) was determined as the most likely stimulation site on the cortex. In all subjects, it was located at the lateral part of the hand knob in the motor cortex. Comparisons of model calculations with the solutions obtained in this manner reveal that the stimulated cortex area innervating the target muscle is substantially smaller than the size of the electric field induced by the coil. Our results help to resolve fundamental questions raised by motor mapping studies as well as motor threshold measurements.},

@article{Thielscher.2004,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To compare two commonly used TMS coils, namely the Medtronic MC-B70 double coil and the Magstim 70 mm double coil, with respect to their electric field distributions induced on the cortex.

METHODS

Electric field properties are calculated on a hemisphere representing the cortex using a spherical head model. The coil designs are characterised using several parameters, such as focality, efficiency and stimulation depth.

RESULTS

Medtronic and Magstim coils exhibit similar focality values and stimulation depths, despite very different coil designs. However, the Medtronic coil is about 1.2 times more efficient compared to the Magstim coil. This difference corresponds to different motor and visual phosphene thresholds obtained in previous physiological studies, thereby validating the chosen coil modelling approach. Focality of the Medtronic coil changed less with varying coil-cortex distance compared to the Magstim coil, whereas both coils exhibited similar dependencies on changes in cortex radius.

CONCLUSIONS

The similar values for focality and stimulation depth indicate that both coil types should evoke similar physiological effects when adjusting for the different efficiencies. The different physiological thresholds of the two coils can be traced back to differences in coil design. Ideally, focality should depend neither on coil-cortex distance nor on cortex radius in order to allow for an inter-subject comparability. In particular, in motor mapping experiments the size of the resulting maps is affected by these two parameters. Consequently, they are at least partially the cause of the variability across subjects seen in these experiments.},

However, they are still far from being established as standard tools for the planning and analysis in practical applications of TMS. Here, we start by delineating three main challenges that need to be addressed to unravel their full potential. This comprises (i) identifying and dealing with the model uncertainties, (ii) establishing a clear link between the induced fields and the physiological stimulation effects, and (iii) improving the usability of the tools for field calculation to the level that they can be easily used by non-experts. We then introduce a new version of our pipeline for field calculations (www.simnibs.org) that substantially simplifies setting up and running TMS and tDCS simulations based on Finite-Element Methods (FEM). We conclude with a brief outlook on how the new version of SimNIBS can help to target the above identified challenges.},

 abstract = {Regional cerebral blood flow and blood volume changes that occur during human brain activity will change the local impedance of that cortical area, as blood has a lower impedance than that of brain. Theoretically, such impedance changes could be measured from scalp electrodes and reconstructed into images of the internal impedance of the head. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a newly developed technique by which impedance measurements from the surface of an object are reconstructed into impedance images. It is fast, portable, inexpensive, and noninvasive, but has a relatively low spatial resolution. EIT images were recorded with scalp electrodes and an EIT system, specially optimized for recording brain function, in 39 adult human subjects during visual, somatosensory, or motor activity. Reproducible impedance changes of about 0.5{\%} occurred in 51/52 recordings, which lasted from 6 s after the stimulus onset to 41 s after stimulus cessation. When these changes were reconstructed into impedance images, using a novel 3-D reconstruction algorithm, 19 data sets demonstrated significant impedance changes in the appropriate cortical region. This demonstrates, for the first time, that significant impedance changes, which could form the basis for a novel neuroimaging technology, may be recorded in human subjects with scalp electrodes. The final images contained spatial noise and strategies to reduce this in future work are presented.},

The effective medium model indicates a strong linear relationship between the conductivity and diffusion tensor eigenvalues (respectively, final sigma and d) in agreement with theoretical bounds and experimental measurements presented here (final sigma/d approximately 0.844 +/- 0.0545 S small middle dots/mm(3), r(2) = 0.945).

 abstract = {{\dq}While magnetic devices are used in a range of applications, the availability of up-to-date books on magnetic measurements is quite limited. Collecting state-of-the-art knowledge from information scattered throughout the literature, Handbook of Magnetic Measurements covers a wide spectrum of topics pertaining to magnetic measurements. It describes magnetic materials and sensors, the testing of magnetic materials, and applications of magnetic measurements. Suitable for specialists as well as readers with minimal knowledge of magnetic measurements, the book begins with an easy-to-follow introduction to the essentials of magnetic measurements. It then offers a comprehensive review of various modern magnetic materials, such as soft and hard magnetic materials and thin magnetic films. The text also describes all commonly used magnetic field sensors, including inductive, fluxgate, Hall, magnetoresistive, resonance, SQUID, magnetoelastic, and magnetooptical sensors. The final chapters discuss the nondestructive testing of materials and explore applications related to magnetic measurements, including magnetic diagnostics in medicine, magnetoarcheology, and magnetic imaging. A thorough overview of magnetic measurements, this handbook helps readers navigate the sometimes impenetrable terms of the field. It also assists them in the quest to design electromagnetic devices in a more effective way{\dq}--},

Industrieroboter mit hohen Traglasten zeichnen sich durch einen gro{\ss}en Arbeitsraum aus und erfordern im Vergleich zu konventionellen FSW-Anlagen einen geringeren Investitionsaufwand. Dadurch k{\"o}nnte die Anwendung des R{\"u}hrreibschwei{\ss}ens auch f{\"u}r kmU mit Blick auf die Anschaffungskosten f{\"u}r die Schwei{\ss}anlage interessant werden. Mangels Erfahrungen mit dem Roboter zum R{\"u}hrreibschwei{\ss}en werden diese Systeme hierf{\"u}r bislang nicht eingesetzt. Des Weiteren bestehen die bisherigen Anwendungen lediglich meist nur aus geraden Schwei{\ss}n{\"a}hten, aus N{\"a}hten in der Ebene oder {\"u}ber gro{\ss}e Umf{\"a}nge. Erfahrungen mit dem Schwei{\ss}en {\"u}ber enge Radien im dreidimensionalen Raum existieren daher fast nicht. Industrieroboter bieten gegen{\"u}ber anderen Handhabungssystemen eine sehr hohe Bewegungsflexibilit{\"a}t, die es erlaubt, theoretisch beliebigen Schwei{\ss}nahtkonturen zu folgen, sofern keine (Eigen-)Kollisionen auftreten und sich die Achsbewegungen innerhalb der zugelassenen Geschwindigkeiten und Beschleunigungen befinden. Gerade in der Automobilindustrie k{\"o}nnen Schwei{\ss}nahtgeometrien mitunter sehr komplex gestaltet sein. Ziel der Arbeit soll es deshalb sein, den Robotereinsatz f{\"u}r das R{\"u}hrreibschwei{\ss}en mit Einschwei{\ss}tiefen im Bereich einiger Millimeter genauer zu untersuchen und die Grundlagen f{\"u}r das Schwei{\ss}en {\"u}ber enge Radien hinweg zu schaffen.},

TMS allows neurostimulation and neuromodulation, while tDCS is a purely neuromodulatory application. TMS and tDCS allow diagnostic and interventional neurophysiology applications, and focal neuropharmacology delivery. However, the physics and basic mechanisms of action remain incompletely explored. Following an overview of the history and current applications of noninvasive brain stimulation, we review stimulation device design principles, the electromagnetic and physical foundations of the techniques, and the current knowledge about the electrophysiologic basis of the effects. Finally, we discuss potential biomedical and electrical engineering developments that could lead to more effective stimulation devices, better suited for the specific applications.},

@article{Wang.2013,
 abstract = {In this work we propose a biologically realistic local cortical circuit model (LCCM), based on neural masses, that incorporates important aspects of the functional organization of the brain that have not been covered by previous models: (1) activity dependent plasticity of excitatory synaptic couplings via depleting and recycling of neurotransmitters and (2) realistic inter-laminar dynamics via laminar-specific distribution of and connections between neural populations. The potential of the LCCM was demonstrated by accounting for the process of auditory habituation. The model parameters were specified using Bayesian inference. It was found that: (1) besides the major serial excitatory information pathway (layer 4 to layer 2/3 to layer 5/6), there exists a parallel {\dq}short-cut{\dq} pathway (layer 4 to layer 5/6), (2) the excitatory signal flow from the pyramidal cells to the inhibitory interneurons seems to be more intra-laminar while, in contrast, the inhibitory signal flow from inhibitory interneurons to the pyramidal cells seems to be both intra- and inter-laminar, and (3) the habituation rates of the connections are unsymmetrical: forward connections (from layer 4 to layer 2/3) are more strongly habituated than backward connections (from Layer 5/6 to layer 4). Our evaluation demonstrates that the novel features of the LCCM are of crucial importance for mechanistic explanations of brain function. The incorporation of these features into a mass model makes them applicable to modeling based on macroscopic data (like EEG or MEG), which are usually available in human experiments. Our LCCM is therefore a valuable building block for future realistic models of human cognitive function.},

 abstract = {This study focuses on neuromuscular mechanisms behind ankle torque and EMG variability during a maintained isometric plantar flexion contraction. Experimentally obtained torque standard deviation (SD) and soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius EMG envelope mean and SD increased with mean torque for a wide range of torque levels. Computer simulations were performed on a biophysically-based neuromuscular model of the triceps surae consisting of premotoneuronal spike trains (the global input, GI) driving the motoneuron pools of the soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, which activate their respective muscle units. Two types of point processes were adopted to represent the statistics of the GI: Poisson and Gamma. Simulations showed a better agreement with experimental results when the GI was modeled by Gamma point processes having lower orders (higher variability) for higher target torques. At the same time, the simulations reproduced well the experimental data of EMG envelope mean and SD as a function of mean plantar flexion torque, for the three muscles. These results suggest that the experimentally found relations between torque-EMG variability as a function of mean plantar flexion torque level depend not only on the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron pools and the muscle units innervated, but also on the increasing variability of the premotoneuronal GI spike trains when their mean rates increase to command a higher plantar flexion torque level. The simulations also provided information on spike train statistics of several hundred motoneurons that compose the triceps surae, providing a wide picture of the associated mechanisms behind torque and EMG variability.},

 abstract = {Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) testing is widely used to detect defects in pipelines, rail track and other structures. The measurement of the two field components perpendicular to the test surface and parallel to the applied field in MFL systems is well established. This work explores the advantages of extending this technique to include the y-axis, orthogonal to the material surface and the applied field, by employing a high-sensitivity three-axis magnetic field sensor. Several MFL tests were undertaken on steel samples, including a section of rail track. Test results show that data from the y-axis can give additional positional information about defects, being especially advantageous where the defect is aligned close to parallel to the applied field. The work concludes that 3D magnetic field sensing could be used to improve the defect characterisation capabilities of existing MFL systems, especially where defects have irregular geometries.},

@article{Zhang.2018,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Local field potential (LFP) recordings along a deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead can provide useful feedback for titrating DBS therapy. However, conventional DBS leads with four cylindrical macroelectrodes likely undersample the spatial distribution of sinks and sources in a given brain region. In this study, we investigated the spectral power and spatial feature sizes of LFP activity in non-human primate subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using chronically implanted 32-channel directional DBS arrays.

APPROACH

Subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus LFP signals were recorded from directional DBS arrays in the resting state and during a reach-and-retrieval task in two non-human primates in na{\"i}ve and parkinsonian conditions. LFP recordings were compared amongst bipolar pairs of electrodes using individual and grouped electrode configurations, with the latter mimicking the cylindrical macroelectrode configurations used in current clinical LFP recordings.

MAIN RESULTS

Recordings from these DBS arrays showed that (1) beta oscillations have spatial 'fingerprints' in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, and (2) that these oscillations were muted when grouping electrode contacts together to create cylindrical macroelectrodes similar in relative dimension to those used clinically. Further, these maps depended on parkinsonian condition and whether the subject was resting or performing a motor task.

SIGNIFICANCE

Development of future closed-loop DBS therapies that rely on LFP feedback will benefit from implanting DBS arrays with electrode sizes and spacings that are more consistent with the dimensions of oscillatory sinks and sources within the brain.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we provide a systematic comparison of various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization using six carefully chosen test functions. Each test function involves a particular feature that is known to cause difficulty in the evolutionary optimization process, mainly in converging to the Pareto-optimal front (e.g., multimodality and deception). By investigating these different problem features separately, it is possible to predict the kind of problems to which a certain technique is or is not well suited. However, in contrast to what was suspected beforehand, the experimental results indicate a hierarchy of the algorithms under consideration. Furthermore, the emerging effects are evidence that the suggested test functions provide sufficient complexity to compare multiobjective optimizers. Finally, elitism is shown to be an important factor for improving evolutionary multiobjective search.},
